***Why we make these graph??
1. to have a intuitively look at our data. Find some pattern if there exist.
2. Find if we have a vector extremely correlated with our response vector (but answer is no)
3. *Check the GAUSSIAN ASSUMPTION: workclass maybe Gaussian. But some of them obviously not: like Native country. Hoursperweek
and education, etc.
