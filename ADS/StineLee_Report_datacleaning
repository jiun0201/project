About ? mark
Why we decide to delete ? instead of other procedures?

1.	? mark only appear only on 2nd, 7th 14th column and some row(observation) contains more than 2 missing value. If we delete those row, we still have 30162 observations which should be enough to start our analysis. Otherwise, our data set will be very messy.

2.	Besides, we also noticed that the original data set has 48842 observations. And for preparation, 3620 observations with unknown data(NA) have already been deleted in our data-description file. Therefore we should continue the way we treat missing values.
