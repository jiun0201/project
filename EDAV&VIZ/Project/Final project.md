## Final Project Submission ##

The link to my repository with the final project (hopefully correctly tagged with version 1) is [here](https://github.com/bwelsh/project4701/releases/tag/v1.0).

If that does not work, the write-up for my project is [here](https://github.com/bwelsh/project4701/blob/gh-pages/assets/project/bw2434_project_write-up.pdf), and the remainder of the files were located in the folder that contains that pdf.

Lastly, the map is now located [here](http://bwelsh.github.io/project4701/assets/project/d3worldmap.html).
