* Comments: I have two projects that I want to work on, preferably "Project 2: Can tweet data act as a early warning tool for natural hazards?"
However, as far as I know, Twitter don't release historical data. But I may be wrong. So I am more leaning toward Project 1 which more details are listed below.

## Project1: Learning about political events ##
What can we learn based on what has happened over the last 35 years using GDELT data?

### Overall Goal ###
1. Find patterns and trends given the historical database 
; Heat mapping over time, distinguishing the real signals from noises
2-1. Discover spatial spillover/diffusion of conflict/protest
2-2. Develop statistical models for predicting future conflict 
3. (Optional) Verify if GDELT could be used as an alternative data source. 
; Compare GDELT with other databases such as UNHCR, WFP, or Tweets data by looking into correlations and find out if they could be combined 

### Iteration Plan 1 ###
* Overview previous work of GDELT data
* Play with dataset to understand and get accustomed to it in general
* Familiarize myself with Python/D3
 
### Future Plans ###
* Data wrangling and munging for subset data of my focused area/country/region for further analysis
* Prepare for clean dataset
* Try to improve or add insights to data presentations such as GDELT daily
* Exploratory (spatial) data analysis
* Decide on statistical methods to analyze the spillover effect of protest across countries or to predict future events or both!

I am looking for a team member who's willing to work together with me!
