There has been a lot of attention around analyzing social media data for emergency response. When hurricaine 'Sandy' occurred, twitter played an important role in supplementing to the mainstream news for quicker disaster relief. While it is a seemingly useful source for information, it also has a sort of downside of user-generated content information: inaccurate news. 

I would like to do two things: 1) Revisit the mainstream dataset - The Global Data Event, Language and Tone (GDELT) dataset, a single public and global event data from mainstream media sources. 2) Compare the data with Twitter data.

## Project1: Learning about crisis ##
What can we learn based on what has happened over the last 35 years using GDELT data?

### Overall Goal ###
Detecting temporal, spatial signal
Finding features, signatures of leaders behavior. With known behaviors, build classifications. 

1. Time series data mining
Time series data mining combines data mining with time series analysis to:
Extract features of time series data (such as seasonal patterns, etc.) for building better predictive models.
Reduce time series data into fewer dimensions by using data mining methods, such as variable selection and clustering.
Conduct similarity analysis of time series data (pattern detection) for segmenting data, or validating forecasts of new products.
Comparison GDELT, Official data, Twitter
2. the signal and noise ratio
Predicting futures
1. Find patterns and trends given the historical database 
; Heat mapping over time, distinguishing the real signals from noises
2-1. Discover spatial spillover/diffusion of conflict/protest
2-2. Develop statistical models for predicting future conflict 
3. (Optional) Verify if GDELT could be used as an alternative data source. 
relating trends in Twitter conversations with external indicators (e.g. conversations around the price of rice in Indonesia mimicking the official inflation statistics).
; Compare GDELT with other databases such as UNHCR, WFP, or Tweets data by looking into correlations and find out if they could be combined 
Scrapping effort

### Iteration Plan 1 ###
* Learning about dataset by playing with it
* Reading published papers and articles
(Unfortunately, the GDELT blog contains lots of materials and previous work has suspended )
* Overview previous work of GDELT data
* Play with dataset to understand and get accustomed to it in general
* Familiarize myself with Python/D3
 
### Future Plans ###
* Data wrangling and munging for subset data of my focused area/country/region for further analysis
* Prepare for clean dataset
* Try to improve or add insights to data presentations such as GDELT daily
* Exploratory (spatial) data analysis
* Decide on statistical methods to analyze the spillover effect of protest across countries or to predict future events or both!
