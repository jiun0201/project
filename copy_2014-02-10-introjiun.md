*Hello EDV class*

I am a first year graduate student in Statistics, Tech savvy individual, Wanna-be-data scientist/communicator.

Prior to joining Columbia, I've worked for the United Nations as a statistical consultant for about 4.5 years in Thailand.
There, I was amazed by the power of exploratory data analysis or effective data visualization to bridge knowledge across multiple disciplines and to convey results to different audiences.

My goal is to equip myself with the ability to combine exploratory data analytics with predictive algorithm so as to understand human social behavior.

I am a climbing, hiking, traveling, dancing, coffee, and wine enthusiast!!

Look very much forward to working on projects!
