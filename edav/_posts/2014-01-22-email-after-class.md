Hi all &mdash; 

1. Students not in IDSE are, from my understanding, supposed to make their case to the Statistics department on this [this form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dG1NLUI4emRtVHNxUHpETktlc095VXc6MA). The only knowledge I have of a maximum is that the room says 51. At last I checked a moment ago, there were 52; so it may be that everyone can stay. Just fill out the form, and if there&#39;s something else for me to sign on Monday I will be happy to do.[1]
2. The [course site](http://malecki.github.io/edav/) / [syllabus](http://malecki.github.io/edav/intro.html)
  - I pushed tag &#39;v1.0&#39; today. To the extent a syllabus is a contract, v1.0 is that.
  - The [day-to-day schedule](http://malecki.github.io/edav/agenda.html) will probably change. In the future, you can diff [this file](https://github.com/malecki/edav/blob/gh-pages/_data/agenda.yaml) against v1.0. 
3. The slides from today are under &#39;blog&amp;slides&#39; [on the page](http://malecki.github.io/edav/2012/01/22/intro/); or, more simply, rendered [inline]( https://github.com/malecki/edav/blob/gh-pages/_posts/2012-01-22-intro.md). You will obviously find it in your fork of the repo. 
4. There is both an &#39;after class&#39; section and some reading for next week. See the [agenda](http://malecki.github.io/edav/agenda.html). 
5. At NAME[2]&rsquo;s suggestion, I created a thing on Piazza. I don&#39;t know much about Piazza, but [voil&agrave;!](https://piazza.com/columbia/spring2014/statw4701/home)
  - Courseworks has a little bit of stuff on it but is deprecated for this class.
  - [deprecated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deprecation)


That's all for now, I think. Have a good rest of the week and weekend.

[1] Yes, I told them that the form says "Univerersity".
[2] Sorry I forgot your name, but I don&#39;t think I knew it to begin with! First day of class.
