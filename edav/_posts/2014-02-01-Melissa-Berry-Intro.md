I am a student in the QMSS (Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences) Master's program here at Columbia.  I am in my second year and attend Columbia on a part-time basis.  I work full-time for SunPower (which makes the world's most efficient solar cells!) as a Business Process Analyst.  In practice that means I manage a construction/project management software that we use for commercial and utility scale solar installations. 

My previous education was in Math and Physics.  I am originally from Denver, CO, but have lived in Kansas and California before moving to NY in the summer of 2012.  

I have some experience with data viz in R and a spattering of exploits in Tilemill, Gephi and D3.  I look forward to learning with and from my classmates this semester!
