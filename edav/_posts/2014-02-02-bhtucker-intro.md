I'm a student in the new IDSE program, which is a major change from my background in urban studies, where I once split my time between social sciences and intellectual history. I've had the opportunity to nourish my latent technical skills and think hard about analysis and developing, and now consider myself to be on the road towards Data Scientist-dom!

I was able to make some decent headway in matplotlib and Pandas in the 'playing with data' I did this week, and you can find more on that [here](https://github.com/malecki/edav/tree/gh-pages/projects/popgraph/bht-hw-0.md)
