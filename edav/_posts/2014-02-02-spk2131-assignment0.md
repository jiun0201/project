## My Repository

I will be keeping my work on the city population data set in a separate github repository: [StephenKappel/dataology/City_Populations](https://github.com/StephenKappel/dataology/tree/master/City_Populations)

## Initial Progress

So far I have fixed the buggy Python script and written an equivalent R script. I was surprised to find that the R script is somewhat more elegant that the Python one.

Currently, I am working on building a view of the data in D3. I will post this to my repo once I have something functional.
