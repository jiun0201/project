## About Me

As is true, I suppose, for many in the class, I'm an aspiring data scientist. My undergraduate degree was in Engineering Management from NYIT. I did software development to pay my way through school, and upon graduation got a job at enterprise software titan [CA Technologies](http://ca.com). 

At CA, I am a Business Analyst on the Business Intelligence team for our Customer Success & Support organization. I am responsible for operational reporting, largely in the forms of spreadsheets and dashboards, used by our organization's management team. In the long term, I would like to spend less of my time doing routine reporting and more time doing insightful analysis (data science). My prime area of interest is customer-centric analysis. How can CA better understand its customers, their needs, their wants, their experience, and their opinions of CA?

My technical skills include Java (my first language), C# (my favorite language), SQL-Transact (a daily necessity in BI), QlikView (for dashboarding), ASP.NET, SharePoint development, and MS SQL Server. I have dabbled in mapping using AJAX libraries for Google Maps and Bing Maps. Also, I'm familiar with native app development for Android. You can see my work with Android, ASP.NET, and Bing Maps in [MapOnTheRun](http://mapontherun.com).

## Project Ideas

While customer analysis is my real interest, that type of data is not publically shared, so it cannot be my focus for this class. Rather, I plan to focus on primary and secondary education. I am interested in exploring what factors most directly affect student achievement. In particular, I am interested to see if more district spending (higher taxes) in fact improves results. Salary and district financial data may be scraped from [teachersalaryinfo.com](http://www.teachersalaryinfo.com/). I'd like to combine this data with demographic data (such as average family income, racial background, etc.) from the [National Center for Education Statistics](http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/sdds/index.aspx), SAT data (some data [here](http://php.democratandchronicle.com/RocDocs/sat/), plus I made a request to College Board for additional data), and NY State test results from the New York Department of Education (data [here](https://reportcards.nysed.gov/) and [here](http://www.p12.nysed.gov/irs/pressRelease/20130807/home.html)).

As the 2014 Winter Olympics unfold, I think data about these events might also be interesting to delve into.
