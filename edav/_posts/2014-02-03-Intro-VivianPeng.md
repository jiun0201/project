Hi, I'm Vivian- a 2nd year MPH student (studying Public Health Informatics), and freelance graphic designer. Coffee, dance, "serious" .gifs enthusiast.

I make infographics for Doctors Without Borders (which hopefully never end up on our Graphs of the Day portion of class, but of course critique is always welcomed). I'm interested in learning data visualization tools to improve on my work.
