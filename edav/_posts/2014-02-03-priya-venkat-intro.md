Hi All, this is Priya (official name is Gnanapriya Venkatasubramaniam, I know too long :) ) I am student of the graduate certificate program in Data Sciences, an undergrad in Instrumention Engineering, an IT consultant with 6 years of experience for JPMorgan Chase and a proud mother of a 2 yr old busy toddler :)

At Chase, I was part of several Data Migration/Conversion projects like Wamu-Chase Merger, BankOne-Chase merger etc. I started my career as a Mainframe Developer and then moved towards Business Analysis and Project Management. I am self trained in Cloudera's MapReduce framework (Hadoop, HBase, Pig and Hive). I am also trying to execute few simple tasks in Amazon EMR (Elastic MapReduce) to perform sentimental analysis of Twitter data. I am new to R and Python. I am looking forward to learn Data modelling and Visualization.
