## A Brief Introduction

I am an experimental physicist in the process of morphing into a data scientist. After spending about a decade tinkering in basement labs, exploring new materials that could potentially replace Silicon as the predominant material with which computers are made, I decided to shift gears completely and enter the fascinating world of data science.

For now I am getting my feet wet with the various ways in which big data can help us understand even previously unquantifiable fields. Text analytics and learning analytics are presently piquing my interest.

Looking forward to creating something aesthetically pleasing while being quantitatively relevant and accurate.
