#[Bryan Kaufman](http://about.me/bkaufman)

 I'm currently part of the IDSE Certification program at Columbia Unviversity, hoping to strengthen my data analytical skills and meet others interested in the space!  I got my undergraduate degree from [NYU Stern](http://www.stern.nyu.edu/programs-admissions/undergraduate) and went to work for [CVC Credit Partners](http://www.cvc.com/Credit-Partners.htmx) for two years before deciding to pursue a more analytical path with my career. For my current day job, I work for a start-up called EntryCareers.com, which uses data to find the best fit for both employee and employers of entry level positions.   I also have a particular interest in sports analytics and recently started a blog called [BigDataHoops](http://bigdatahoops.com/)

 
##Example of what you will see [at my blog](http://bkaufman.github.io/)
 
I hope to use my blog as a place to further my interest in sports analytics.  I feel, especially with basketball, there has been more and more data generated that can provide strategic [insights](http://www.sloansportsconference.com/?p=10462) to teams.
