Hi everyone, I'm Jed. I'm my second year at Columbia working on the last semester of a QMSS masters program,
with a concentration in Data Science. I've worked for the past 3 years as an analyst in the public sector,
specifically in the foster care domain. Right now I work at a small tech company called Case Commons. We build
web applications for state foster care agencies, and I get to play with longitudinal data all day. My goals
for the course include getting better at presenting complicated information in a clear manner and strengthening
my skills with d3 and other web-based interactive visualizations.

Here are some of my favorite data visualization blogs and sites:
