## A Brief Introduction

I am Darren Xing.  I am data analyst working at marketing and advertising industry.  And I am also a part time data science student at Columbia University.  The clients I have been worked on are pharmaceutical companies as well as government agency.

I have used various tools including excel, PowerPoint, Xcelsius and Tableau at work for data visualization.  

I have worked on 2010 US Census project, our team building a google map application to track real time response and can adjust marketing spending in the real time to achieve the project planned goals.

I always find the data visualization is self expression and there is no standard way to follow up to make your data stand out.  I hope I could learn what is the best practices for data visualization through this class and also new ways to do graphs.
