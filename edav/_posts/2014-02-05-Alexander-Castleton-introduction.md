I am a student in the IDSE certificate program here at Columbia.  Besides taking Modern Analysis I and II over the summer, this program is my first year with Columbia University.

For the past 3 years, since I graduated with my Bachelors in Math and Computer Science, I have been working as the Head Math tutor for the tutoring center at Pace University's Pleasantville campus, as well as tutoring privately and teaching an extracurricular math course for Middle School kids.  I also manage several department websites for Pace.

A major difficulty for me is my commute to Columbia campus, because I live about an hour away by train in the middle of Westchester county.  The recent blizzards have made things even more difficult.

Besides a mastery over MS Excel, my experience with Data Visualization is minimal.  I have used Matlab and Mathematica extensively, but my exposure to Python and R is very limited.  Git is 100% new to me.  My most familiar programming language (outside of web-design) would have to be Java (which was convenient last semester for algorithms class).  I have dabbled in google scripting and ArcGIS in the past as well.

I look forward to learning techniques in this class for presenting clear data that stands out and tells an interesting story.
