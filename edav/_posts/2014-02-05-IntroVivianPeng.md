Hi, I'm Vivian, a second year MPH informatics student and freelance graphic designer. I am a coffee, dance, and "serious" .gifs enthusiast. 

I design infographics for Doctors Without Borders (which will hopefully never end up in our Charts of the Day section in class, but feedback is always welcomed). Looking forward to learning data visualization tools to improve on my work.
