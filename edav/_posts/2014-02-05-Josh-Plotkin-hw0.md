## What I've Done

- played around with the csv data in excel, trying to present it in different ways.
- plotted it in 2 ways in Excel. I figure if I can get some graphs I like, I can use that as a goal to try to plot using ggplot2 in the coming days. Eventually, I'd like to move toward D3.js.

	* took % share of total US population for each city, and plotted the median of the top 20 with each of the top 5 cities

	* since the median is trending upward, I attempted to normalize by that by dividing the previous numbers (% of total US population) by the median for each year.
