## Who I Am

My name is Josh Plotkin and I'm a student at IDSE. This is my second tour of Columbia, previously graduating with a B.S. from the IEOR department in 2006. I've been in NYC ever since, now living in Chelsea with my wife and 2 dogs.

## Where I've Been

I've had an... untraditional path since graduating from college. Up until January, I've made a living entirely through playing and teaching poker. I work for an instructional website, for which I've made about 250 hourlong videos and 60 podcosts since 2008. I have played roughly 3 million hands of poker lifetime. 

In January, I started working for a data visualization consulting firm. I do work for WPP, the largest advertising agency in the world. With $18bn in revenues in 2013, 180k employees, and hundreds of subsidiaries, WPP offers endless possibilities for analyzing and presenting data. I might try to use some of WPP's publically available data to try to improve upon some of visualization work we currently do.

I have been a sports fanatic for as long as I can remember, and since reading about this course, I had visions of creating graphs of baseball data. One of my favorite sites is www.fangraphs.com. Fangraphs is all about data. They host loads of it, they publish articles analyzing it, and as the name suggests, those articles nearly always include visuals of some sort. Sometimes the authors leave huge tables of numbers, or post some pretty ugly graphs, so I look forward to trying to improve upon what they do.

## Where I Hope to Go

There is no shortage of data that I hope to analyze and present, but right now I lack the knowledge to do much of anything with it (outside of Excel). I'm looking forward to learning the tools of the trade in this course, specifically D3.js.
