+	I am a master student in statistics department. This is my second semester here at Columbia.
+	I usually use R for data analysis. But It seems that I need to learn a lot of programming in the class and get prepared to be a data scientist.
+	I'm focusing on some video game industry data, because I like it and I want to find a job in this industry after graduate from school. Hopefully I can get some fun result from it.
