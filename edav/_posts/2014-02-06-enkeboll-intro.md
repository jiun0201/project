This is an introductory paragraph about myself, in which I will also be learning some markdown.

Currently
---------
I moved to New York last fall after accepting a data engineering position at Venmo.  I also started taking classes at Columbia at that time with the IDSE certificate program.  I hope to continue on and get my masters degree from Columbia.

Previously
----------

Prior to moving to New York, I lived in Nashville, TN.  While there, I:
 + Graduated with a degree in Computer Engineering from Vanderbilt University
 + Taught high school math and statistics through the Teach for America program
 + Worked as a financial consulting analyst for a small collections consulting firm

I am originally from Auburn, AL where my father and brother are both connected to Auburn University.
