### My Work and Play

I studied economics in undergrad and have been working at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Risk Department. My primary task is to create payment risk models. Naturally, I deal with a lot of data. At any given moment at work, I am either try to force quit Microsoft Access, whispering obscenities at someone else's buggy SAS program or hiding from colleagues who want me to fix their ODBC connection. I miss school a lot and when I heard about the DATA SCIENCE CERTIFICATE PROGRAM, I was excited to learn the skills that will make me a data whiz (still a long, long way to go).

Serious business aside, I am an avid sports fan. I follow football and boxing religiously. I am a boxer myself (strawweight) and had been training to compete at the amateur level prior to the start of the Data Science program. I go crazy when I find a really good graph on sports statistics. Deadspin is the first thing I read when I wake up in the morning. I hope to learn how to visualize sports data in awesome ways.
