### My background
I am currently a student in the first year in [QMSS](http://qmss.columbia.edu) and also one of the Certificate in Data Science candidate in [IDSE](http://idse.columbia.edu).<br>
Before Columbia, I had a Financial Economics BA degree and a Computer Science minor back in Peking University. In my understanding, Data Science is a fantastic field that combines computer science and economics/business together and I am hoping to make my own contribution in this area.<br>
I am now having a part-time job in a New-York based startup [Agolo](http://agolo.com), which is, in my understanding, basically a personal twitter news filter and recommendation. Both machine learning and data visualization skills would be heavily leveraged to help predict people's preference in order to customize the twitter news feeds for individuals.<br>
Two of my favorite things are NBA and snooker. So if anyone wants to hold a NBA off-season party or shoot pool, just add me in!<br>
Last but not the least, I am really looking forward to these two classes and working as a team to do projects!
