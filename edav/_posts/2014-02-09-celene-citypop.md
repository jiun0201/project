### What I did
* Removed the state abbreviations for the few cities that had them
* Added a column from the Google spreadsheet for total populations by year
* Added a column that gave the percentage of total population
* Made a graph in Excel showing the percentages in the top 4 ranked cities over time (I only included 4 because after about 5 the graph shapes weren't different, and I'd like to be able to add more features before deciding if it's necessary to add more)
* Overlayed a graph showing total population trends over time

### Observations and hypotheses
As someone else has already pointed out, there is an interesting bump in percent population lines for the top 2 ranked cities. At first I thought this may have been attributed to a) an influx of people to the major cities right before the depression, or perhaps b) a baby boom right before the depression. But overlaying the total population graph actually shows a small dip during that decade, leading to two better hypotheses: c) more people died outside the top cities than in them, leading to a sharp increase in proportion in the major cities, and d) the Census was inaccurate during that time because of the number of people displaced from their home (and the war). Hypothesis d) is supported by the observation that, if the anomalous point were removed in both the city percentage graphs and the total population graph, the shape of the curve would continue as before from the 1910 point.<BR>

### What I'd like to do
I'd really like to be able to indicate transitions in this graph. I envision putting small arrowheads at the points where the cities transition within a rank - for instance, when New York overtakes Philadelphia for the #1 spot at 1800 - such that when one mouses over the arrowhead, a textbox pops up that succinctly explains what transition happened. I think this would be the most effective and efficient way to provide more details about what's happening on this rank-graph.
