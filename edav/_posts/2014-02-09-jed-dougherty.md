title: Jed's US Population Map in d3
description: Update on US Population Data
tags: assignments intro uspop

I used Assignment 0 as an opportunity to brush off all those
javascript skills I never had and learn a little bit about d3.
My thought process was that this graph was a great opportunity
to show how the population of America has shifted to where the
industry of the era was booming.

I think I'll write up a full blog post about the difficulties I
had in making this and the things I learned if anyone else in the
class is interested. But for now I'll just post links to the actual
visualization, and to my code.

You can navigate through my visualization by pressing any key on your
keyboard to increment forward through the decades. You can roll over
all points on the map to get more information.

There's a lot of things I'd like to make better, but probably
the only other thing ill do with it is have the color
change based on whether rank went up or down from the prior decade.
If you've got other ideas to make the visualization more clear, I would
love to hear them!
