Past
Before Columbia, I got a Bachelor’s degree in mathematics and applied mathematics in Beijing Forestry University. 

Now
I’m currently a M.A. in statistics. Last semester, I learnt a lot of theories and didn’t have much experience in dealing with real complicated data. 
Therefore, I pay more attention to application this semester. This class just opens a door to a new world. I find out I love turning rigid data into dramatic graphs. 
Hope I can know more about new technology and make friends who have a common goal with me here.

Future
My dream is to be an analytical consultant.
