In my present career, I work at MTA Bridges and Tunnels in New York City in the Technology Department with responsibilities in Application Systems Development.
I am mostly focused on Data Warehouse, Data Mining, Business Intelligence and Analytics applications for my organization. Lately I have been interested in
Data Visualization and I hope  taking Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization (EDAV) course is a great way to jumpstart my ambition. 

As a hobby, I experiment and tweak systems in the household such as the Home Theatre and other entertainment systems. These experiments have directed me toward 
innovative ideas in the past. My recent experiment proved to be far more reaching than the previous ones and paid high dividends to my family during the 
Sandy disaster of 2012 when we lost electrical power for an extended period!

update #1:

Some students wanted know what was the experiment I carried out. It was to convert my gas boiler that runs on AC to also run on DC power by installing heavy duty 12V car batteries.
