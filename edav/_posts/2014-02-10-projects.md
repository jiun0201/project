## Scope

The "project" is intended to be an undertaking in your area of interest that is worthy of the approximate a three-month investment of time. Masters students with thesis-related projects may have some advantage in topic selection.

Some suggestions of varying scope:

  * todo lists/wikis/issues of open source projects in data visualization
  * [ggvis](https://github.com/rstudio/ggvis/issues)
  * [ggplot2](https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2/wiki)
  * [python ggplot](https://github.com/yhat/ggplot/blob/master/TODO.md)
  * [crossfilter](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/issues)
  * [pandas](https://github.com/pydata/pandas/wiki)
  * write a tool for exploratory/graphical methods where they are lacking. (e.g. [coefplot](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/coefplot/index.html))
)
  * replication of published research for more edav (e.g. [tables](http://www9.georgetown.edu/grad/gppi/hpi/cew/pdfs/whatsitworth-complete.pdf) to [graphs](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/09/10/219372252/the-most-and-least-lucrative-college-majors-in-1-graph)); [diet study](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1200303); [college instructor studies](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/06/opinion/a-solution-for-bad-teaching.html);
  * improve or add insights to data presentations such as [gdelt daily](http://blog.gdeltproject.org/gdelt-daily-trend-reports/) or [environmental performance index](http://epi.yale.edu/)
  * modeling and presenting data for your other work (making more and better statistical graphics than you would otherwise)

## Assessment

You are expected to write down achievable goals, and objectives with measurable results.

### Iteration Plans

Work should be broken up into three-week sprints with specific objectives. At the end of each sprint, you will evaluate your own progress, and schedule items/objectives for the next three weeks. 

Ideally, you'll complete more than you thought you would in each sprint. By the third iteration plan add items/objectives that you would have been wary of at the outset.


## Overall Goal

Goal: [MRP](https://github.com/malecki/mrp) 2.0

Objectives:

1. Finish a version of [vignette](https://github.com/malecki/mrp/tree/vignette)
1. Update the census data from ipums/acs and survey from cces 
1. Update modeling techniques 
1. Present mrp estimates interactively in the browser - tables, graphs, and map
1. Compute and present uncertainty of estimates

### Example iteration plan

1. Set up project template or package with dummy methods, [testthat](https://github.com/hadley/testthat), and lots of todo text
1. Prove to self that rgdal/geojson work for maps using tutorials
1. Set up template for leaflet choropleth maps
1. Set up js testing stuff ([testem](https://github.com/airportyh/testem)])
1. Write test expectations for a simple `poststratify` method using a  js [ndarray](https://github.com/mikolalysenko/ndarray)
1. Get updated CCES/ACS data; add renames and subsetting to package for replicability.

### Then, Next time: 

1. Write the `poststratify` js test (not done last time) and make it pass to condense arrays
1. Impute missing data in surveys
1. Fit simple models in the surveys
1. Initial refactor `mrp`; consider using reference classes?
