## Project: Online review aggregator

### Goal

To build a review aggregator that, given a parameter(like zipcode, name of restaurant, cuisine, etc.), aggregates reviews of restaurants from various online sources like Yelp, TripAdvisor, Foursquare, Facebook etc and visualizes the reviews to facilitate easier decision making by the user. 

### Objectives

* To come up with a reliable metric that combines various online scores
* Analyze popularity of restaurants based on demographic, geolocation and other such profile parameters.
* Innovative visualizations of the above metrics


### First Iteration Plan - Next 3 weeks 02/12/2014 - 03/05/2014

* Classify the various online sources based on whether they already have a review aggregator or if an aggregator algorithm needs to be applied 
* Get comfortable with R/python and use it to scrape the data from sources that already have an aggregator
* Statistics on scraped data resulting in a reliable metric
* First cut at visualizing this metric

### Future goals

* Familiarize with state of the art review aggregator algorithms/ look into building a new one
* Benchmark this algorithm versus existing ones on popular websites. Apply it to sources that don't already have an aggregated score
* Widen the scope of the project by including images
* Widen the visualization scope of the project by including other parameters like transportation options, recommender systems etc.
