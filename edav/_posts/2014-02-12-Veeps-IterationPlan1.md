Overall Goal Objectives: Create D3 visualizations on San Francisco's housing data for my thesis
1. Visualize the increasing trend in rent over the past 3-5 years and see how that compares to the increasing salaries of tech workers
2. Pull data on eviction rates in SF and compare the influx of "techies" moving into the city vs. people getting kicked out of their homes

Spring plan:
1. Find data on housing information from City and council of San Francisco budget & Legislative Analyst 
2. See if I can pull the original data from this article so I can play with data on Ellis Act evictions: http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/San-Francisco-evictions-surge-report-finds-4955020.php#photo-5417365
3. Data exploration and cleanup
