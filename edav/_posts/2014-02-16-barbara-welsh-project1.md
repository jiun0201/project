## Meta-Analysis of Study Data

### Project Description

In this project I'm hoping to find multiple studies on a similar subject, analyze how they were conducted and what conclusions they came to, then see what more could be learned from those studies, or what in the existing analyses could be improved upon.

### Current Issues

I'm currently stuggling with finding the right studies for this meta-analysis. I've looked through the CDC data as well as data from [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov). Given the volumes of data out there, I've been having trouble figuring out where to go from there, as I don't have a particular subject in mind. I am coming to the conclusion that I may want to start at a different level, looking at what my have been written on various studies, rather than at the studies themselves, then work my way backwards into the studies and actual data. I am a little lost and overwhelmed with finding the right studies at this point though.

### Overall Project Plan

1. Choose studies for meta-analysis
2. Get raw data and recreate results found in existing study
3. Review analysis of existing studies - how were they conducted and what could be improved?
4. Explore further analysis of data - what else can it tell us?
5. Create initial visualizations of new insights gained
6. Refine models and visualizations to best communicate my message

### Iteration 1

1. Review existing data and choose studies for meta-analysis
2. Get raw data
3. Depending on size of raw data, munge and store in R or in mysql database
4. Recreate results of studies being analyzed - understand how existing conclusions were reached, what assumptions were made, etc.
