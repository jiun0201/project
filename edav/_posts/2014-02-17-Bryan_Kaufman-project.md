## What is my project idea ##

- I hope to use data off of either [Basketball Reference](http://www.basketball-reference.com/) or scrape NBA play by play data from ESPN in order to create useful visualization
- If given the play by play data I'd like to find a way to create shot charts

## Sprint 1 Goals ##
- There's a lot of great information off of Basketball Reference
- I feel like there are a lot of useful visualizations that can be made
- I also want to begin to start working on the play by play scraper for ESPN's play by play basketball data


## Data mungling ##
-I plan to use both Python and R 
-I have a lot of experience using R but want to strengthen my Python skills

## Long Term Goals ##
- It seems like the long term goal for me would be to build a play by play data scraper for ESPN.  This would allow me to capture everything that happens in a basketball game.  I could create different shot charts and show lineup synergies.
