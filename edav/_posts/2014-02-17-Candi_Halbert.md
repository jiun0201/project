I believe I have settled on working with cell phone data after looking into NYC 311 data and happiness data. I may 
revisit the happiness idea since it intrigues me more, however locating data seems to be an obstacle.  I didn't feel 
crowd sourced data was what I needed and although it sounds similar, twitter sentiment analysis isn't the type of 
happiness analysis I was thinking of.

So, I've located a manageable data set on human activity recognition using smartphone data.  Pattern recognition in 
this type of data could be useful in understanding and potentially working with data from the explosion of wearable tech and
the data it will generate.

Also looking at trello as a way to keep on track during the semester.
