I set up a Trello board to keep track of my semester project. So far it's fun and easy to use.
I'm still in the brainstorming/planning stages, but I think I've narrowed my ideas down into
a couple things. 

One is a [Feltron](http://feltron.com/) style data visualization of the stuff that is important to 
me. You can check out the details at my Trello.

Another is a machine learning algorithm that would predict short stayers in foster care from a cohort
of children entering the foster care program.

Finally, I would be interested in extending ggplot in some way to be better at showing visualizations of
data that has both categorical input and output.
