## Project 
There are two project ideas I am interested to work on:
(1) study the relation among job market, housing price, and college major.
(2) evaluate the rule of 4-4-3-3 to construct a mutual fund/ETF based investment portfolio.
The final project selection will be determined by the outcome of pre-implementation phase.
Following is a general project plan I intend to follow.

### Pre-implementation (requirement iterations)
- Determine project scope
- Assess project opportunities and risks
- Define preliminary resources (such as software specifications, data source)
- Review scope with the project manager
- \* Delivery timeline: February-March
- \* Deliverable: project high level scope set

### Implementation (development iterations)
- Develop functional specifications 
- Design prototype (degisn - code - test)
- Acceptance testing (including peer reviews)
- \* Delivery timeline: March-April
- \* Delivarable: proof of concept
