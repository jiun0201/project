## Project: Explore Life Insurance Data
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Overview
My day job is a life acutary, so I have exposure to some life insurance policy information. For this project, I would like to closely examine a dataset that contain more than 3 million policies issued over many years. I would like to mine this dataset and hopeful extract some value added insights. Some of the questions that I would like to answer at the end of the project includes:

* Who buys life insurance?
* How much life insurance do people with different backgrounds purchase?
* How do people in this dataset die? Is there any relationship between their cause of death and other variables contained in this dataset?

This is not a exhausted list, as I spend more time wrangling with the dataset, more questions will definitely pop up. 

#### Objectives

Extract insight from a dataset containing information about more than 3 million life insurance policies.

#### Tools
Primarily R and it's graphic packages (ex lattice, ggplot2), will incorporate Python and D3 when needed as project progresses.

####Data 
The aformentioned dataset that contains some basic information about policyholders, such as:

* The Face Amount he/she purchases.
* When and where he/she purchased the policy.
* Type of policy he/she purchased.
* How much/how often is the premium?.
* Is the policyholder alive? IF not, what's the cause of death?.


#### First Sprint
For the three week period between 2/17 and 3/10, I would like to: 

* Talk to the data source and collect data.
* Check for missing data, will need to work with the data source to find alternate database that might contain the same information. Once the alternative data sources are identified, will need to wrangle the data into format that's consistent with the original dataset. 
* Examine the relationships between the variables, and create some preliminary graphs.
* Study some indsutry reports about how this type of data are usually analyzed.
