##Motivation:

Assisted reproductive technology (ART) are methods used to achieve pregnancy by artificial or partially artificial means. Today, over 1% of all infants born in the United States every year are conceived using ART.

According to the CDC, ART includes all fertility treatments in which both eggs and sperm are handled. In general, ART procedures involve surgically removing eggs from a woman?s ovaries, combining them with sperm in the laboratory, and returning them to the woman?s body or donating them to another woman. 

My Exploratory Data Analysis:

1. Descriptive statistics for the success of ART in the US
2. Inferential statistics: past performance of assisted reproduction technologies as a [regression] model to predict future progress
3. explore relationship model of ART risks such as: 
  - multiple births
  - pre-term births
  - increased risk of cancer from ovarian and hormonal stimulation

## Sprint 1

1. Collate data from CDC on 15 years of ART outcomes
2. Collate data from PubMed on risks related to ART
3. Conduct first cut data analysis + viz  in R, to glean patterns and predictors for inferential statistics
