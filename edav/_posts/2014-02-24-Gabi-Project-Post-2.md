### Project Plan Update:
* Downloaded CHSI dataset
* Since the dataset includes many files, I am working on looking through data in 2-3 of the files:
	* Demographics
	* Leading Causes of Death
	* Risk Factors and Access to Care
* Working on cleaning data and subsetting data
* Added git repository for project [here](https://github.com/Gabya06/CHSI)

### CHSI Dataset summary from website (shortened):
> Community Health Status Indicators (CHSI) to combat obesity, heart disease, and cancer are major components of the Community Health Data Initiative. This dataset provides key health indicators for local communities and encourages dialogue about actions that can be taken to improve community health (e.g., obesity, heart disease, cancer). 


#### Main Source of Data:
* [health.data.ny.gov](http://www.healthdata.gov/data/dataset/community-health-status-indicators-chsi-combat-obesity-heart-disease-and-cancer)

 

#### Project plan â€“ Next 3 weeks:
* Continue to work with familiarizing myself with R in working with datasets (subsetting, summarizing and exploring data relationships)
* Continue to try and reduce dataset to focus on important aspects - Currently have wayy too much information
* Perform some statistics to better understand data and any existing relationships
* To explore links between the lack of physical activity and obessity 
* Develop statistics on data resulting in some reliable metric
* First cut at visualization in R
