Blog Post 1 Objective:
---------------
This exercise involved evaluating an existing data blog to assess the scope of analytics it represents, identify it’s short comings from a data analysis and visualization standpoint and determine how intelligence can be artfully presented to users highlighting compelling conclusions. Data pertaining to London Olympics 2012 with specific reference to athletes’ age, height, and weight from all participating countries was selected for insightful data analysis and visualization.

Scope:
------
The primary data dimensions involved the physical attributes of participating athletes in the 2012 London Olympics. A number of relevant data was provided pertaining to medals won, variety of sporting events, place of athletes’ birth, sex, and the country they represented. The Guardian, London’s major newspaper presented the data primarily from the standpoint of Age, Height, and Weight of athletes along quartiles and distribution. Using Tableau Public, users were provided the option to select various sporting events by country and understand the distribution of age, height and weight of athletes.

Limitations:
------------
While the Guardian did a great job providing visually compelling representation of the above data, there was no insightful intelligence provided from this significant global sporting event. For example, no inference was made to the number of medals won and if there is any correlation at all to the dimensions of sex, age, height and weight of athletes. Are female athletes making headway in winning more medals than men? The presentation lacked the capability to compare different countries on these key dimensions to help understand if any country winning medals had any significant advantage over other countries. Also, most importantly a general user looking at this representation cannot immediately appreciate strategic insights unless the underlying data is scrutinized more deeply.

Improvement Opportunities:
--------------------------
It was strongly felt that data for data’s sake no matter how compellingly it is visualized is of no significant or actionable value. I wanted to orient our analysis of these 3 dimensions with the number of medals athletes won. With this fundamental premise in mind, our goal was to improvise this blog data along 3 dimensions – 
1) what type of physical attributes do winning athletes have from all countries?
2) Are female athletes doing better than male athletes and 
3) Can countries be compared to each other along the 3 dimensions to reveal insightful intelligence that can be used to win more medals?

Improvements Achieved:
----------------------
Created dashboard to display the ability to select and compare countries by their medal performance and by the sex of athletes. One could contrast the age of these different countries to see how it correlated to their medal performance. A comparative display was also enabled for how female and male athletes won medals and how their ages compared.
Another key interactive capability was to select any sporting event for the countries selected to see how the weight and age of the athletes and the medal count by men vs. women athletes.

Overall, improvements were achieved to meet the 3 objectives set above. The visual dash board shows key physical attributes like age and weight by country for any sporting event for male and female athletes, infer if female or male athletes winning more gold medals in a country and the ability to compare these attributes against other countries.
