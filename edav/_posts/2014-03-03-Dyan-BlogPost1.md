This blog post is about a [Color-coded map of the world's most and least emotional countries](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2012/11/28/a-color-coded-map-of-the-worlds-most-and-least-emotional-countries/).

The problem with this map is it has no interactive visualization capability. It has a great potential to be enriched by using interactive visualization techniques which will be done in my blog #2 to come. In the mean time just enjoy the article and the comments thrown at the original blog which are given in the All Comments section at the end.
