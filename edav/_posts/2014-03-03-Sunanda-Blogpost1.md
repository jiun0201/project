	## Visualizing sentiment analysis done on tweets
	
	### Scope

	I decided to start with some data I already had : a txt file of tweets between Nov 24th - No 30th 2012 with hashtag 'walmart'. This was collected both to gauge the chatter about walmart close to Thanksgiving and also it was a time w hen the employees were striking to increase minimum pay. So it was interesting to do sentiment analysis on this crosssection of tweets. While there are many interesting ways to visualize sentiment analysis from the twitter feed (see for example: http://www.csc.ncsu.edu/faculty/healey/tweet_viz/) for the scope of this blogpost I wanted to learn more about plotting with R. 

	### What I did

	* Cleaned the nasty txt file I had. 
	* Learnt how to deal with dates in R
	* Used libraries ggplot2 and maps to create the following visualizations
	* Visualizations of tweet frequency and number of tweets from recorded long/lat data

	### What I hope to do 

	* Clean up the errant Lat/Long values
	* Over the coming few days I would like to visualize the tweet frequency in d3 and combine both the geographic and timeline features of the data in one visualization
	* Include the sentiment analysis of the tweets and visualize them in the combined graphic
    
    ### My graphs

    * Tweet frequency as a time series [here] (https://github.com/sunandakp/assets/Sunanda_assets/wm_tweet_map.png)
