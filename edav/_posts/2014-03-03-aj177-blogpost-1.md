## Why Facebook Dropped $19B On WhatsApp - dejunked charts

## The Question:

< a href = "http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/19/facebook-whatsapp/?ncid=twittersocialshare">This blog</a> aims to explain "Why Facebook Dropped $19B On WhatsApp"? Based on the data from Onavo and Jana Mobile, the author concludes that the main reason is WhatsApp's reach into Europe and Emerging markets.

## The Charts:

Since the focus of the blog, is WhatsApp's market share vs Facebook, I would represent this with a sharp faceted bar plot. 

Alternatively, I would visualize market leadership as a choropleth map. In this instance, I used a 5-class sequential, ColorBrewer Blue Green hue and jenks classification. Light blue represents fb messenger prevalence while the green scaling intensity showcases WhatsApp dominance. 

Current viz:

The current world map chart is kitsch and ineffective owing to:

1) display of auxiliary messaging apps market share

2) colors of fb messenger and WhatsApp bar plots are indiscernible

3. the zoom frames are plain kitsch!

## The Data:

The data for the chart "WhatsApp Extraordinary Growth in Users" seems to offer an inappropriate comparison. 

Current viz:

In my opinion, WhatsApp user growth should be compared to rival messaging apps and not social media networks. Chart 3 reveals the 
growth rate of WeChat in China, the largest smart phone market. Did facebook acquire WhatsApp to become a hegemon for WeChat?
