[_"FIFA World cup titles"_](http://yoshi2041.blogspot.com/2010/10/fifa-world-cup-titles.html) is a blog post that attempts to present the number of FIFA world cup championship titles the top 8 countries have captured. While it clearly shows the number of times that each country became the World Cup champion, the pie chart is too noisy and oversimple for the reader to match each country with its corresponding piece of the pie for more information.

I used the data that I scrapped from the FIFA official website to present the same idea, showing how well the top 8 countries did in terms of how many titles they captured. However, the mere number of titles is not a good indication of each country's performance. I wanted to take into consideration the number of times the top 8 countries participated in the World Cup overall so that I can show the relationship between participation and championship. Another aspect of the graph that I changed was that I presented the number of times all FIFA participating countries, rather than just the top 8 countries, partook in the game.

The bar graph that I presented here is still a work in progress. In the next few days, I would like to not only include the champions (in color gold), but also the runner-ups (in color silver), third prize winners (in color bronze), and fourth prize winners (in color gray) so that the graph will have a more comprehensive representation of the performance of all participating countries.
