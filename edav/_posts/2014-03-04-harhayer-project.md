## Project ##

With my project I want to bring out some interesting facts about vehicles vs gallons consumed vs hybrid and electric vehicles 
With the outcome I want to show us how have we changed to drive in last decade I will be taking data yearly from 1985.The hard part is scrapping 
for now as I am picking up data from bunch of different sources.

## Steps to Project ##
1.Research what kind of data related to vehicles is available online.

2.Found some data sources as mentioned in this post.

3.Learn and use python to scrap data from these websites.

4.Keep learning R to use it as I am not still expert at that.

5.Along the way if I find anything else that I can compare and anlyse my existing data I would like to add that to current
data.

6.Compare and show graphs comparing the gallons consumed vs vehicles and hybrids and show how the consumption has changed.

7.I want to come up with predictive graph for future for which I will be using modelling and making some data from past data.

## Completed till now ##

1.Research what kind of data related to vehicles is available online.

2.Found some data sources as mentioned in this post.

3.Learn python to scrap some data from these websites but still working on completing the scraping part.

## Future what I want to do ##

1.Complete steps 3 to 7.

2.As I get comfortable with my project I am sure I will have roadblocks so plan on posting here a lot.
