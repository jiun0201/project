## Educational Data Meta-Analysis

### Project Description

Since the start of the first sprint, I've narrowed my focus to the domain of eductional data and assessments. I have chosen to focus on two assessments in math and science given worldwide: PISA and TIMSS. There are a number of analyses comparing the two exams and my project will review and analyze those analyses. I intend to focus on the studies seeking to explain why certain countries do better than others on one exam or another. If feasible, I would like to look at the results from subsequent exams (PISA is administered every three years and TIMSS every four years) to see which analyses and conclusions hold.

### Iteration 1 - Progress

In this iteration, I found a domain to work in - educational assessment - and set about the task of reviewing the data that is out there in an effort to narrow my focus. I started by looking at [PISA](http://www.oecd.org/pisa) data, and wondered if there were similar assessments out there, and how each might stack up. I found a number of them, but most were confined to a single country. I was able to find one other exam, [TIMSS](http://timss.bc.edu) that is also given internationally. They make for a good comparison because PISA is given to 15 year olds and TIMMS to 8th graders, leading to a number of studies and reviews comparing the two. [This one](https://edsurveys.rti.org/PISA/documents/WuA_Critical_Comparison_of_the_Contents_of_PISA_and_TIMSS_psg_WU_06.1.pdf) for instance, sought to explain why western countries tended to do better on PISA and eastern countries tended to do better on TIMSS. Three others that I have found so far are [here](http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/download/5km4psnm13nx.pdf?expires=1393989823&id=id&accname=guest&checksum=81C333F20EA10D4F8FD01B2B9CD6736A), [here](http://www.iea.nl/fileadmin/user_upload/IRC/IRC_2006/Papers/IRC2006_Hutchison_Schagen.pdf), and [here](http://nces.ed.gov/timss/pdf/naep_timss_pisa_comp.pdf). These studies use data from exams administered in 2003 or earlier. In addition to reviewing literature, I have gathered a small piece of the data so far (US data only), because it was easier to obtain, and am starting to become familiar with it. 

Below are the tasks I had set out for this iteration:

1. Review existing data and choose studies for meta-analysis
2. Get raw data
3. Depending on size of raw data, munge and store in R or in mysql database
4. Recreate results of studies being analyzed - understand how existing conclusions were reached, what assumptions were made, etc.

I have completed (1), and made a start on (2) and (3). Item (4) is yet to be done, but the actual recreation of results may not be appropriate. I spent quite a bit more time than I expected researching exams and studies in order to refine the project, and that was what set me back a bit in this sprint.

### Iteration 2 - Goals

1. Summarize conclusions reached in studies being analyzed. Understand their methodology.
2. Get all of the raw data that is needed into usable form, likely 2003 data as well as PISA data from 2006, 2009 and/or 2012 and TIMSS data from 2007 and/or 2011.
3. Begin analysis necessary in order to determine which conclusions hold for future exams.
