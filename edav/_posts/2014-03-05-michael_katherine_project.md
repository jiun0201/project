### Visualization of Comparisons in Patterns of Interaction in Movie Scripts(screenplays)
Project Member: Michael Jiang(zj2160) & Katherine Guo(kgv2107) <br>
The general goal of our project is to explore movies scripts(screenplays) in recent years(more explicitly, from 1990) to unveil the pattern of verbal interaction between characters. We would like to compare these patterns over different time periods and over different genres. In our presumptions, at least for different genres, the verbal interaction between characters would vary hugely, for example, in romantic movies, large portion of verbal interaction would happen within a limited group of people, while in scifi movies, the verbal interaction would be more evenly distributed over characters. <br>
The data source currently crawled is Internet Movie Script Database [IMSDb](http://www.imsdb.com) in which there are enough complete scripts for us to dive into. Also, one advantage of the scripts is that the scripts is highly structured due to the organizational tags in html, therefore, we could utilize to tell all the components of a scripts apart.  <br>
The project plan is roughly as follows and would subject to any updates later on, the steps are attached a priority score in range of 0:3 :   <br>
Step 1: Build a crawler to retrieve scripts of movies within a genre list. The time period is confined to be 1990 to 2010. Priority = 3. Status = Complete.    <br>
Step 2: Identify all included film genres using metadata associated with the film script and divide the scripts into different genre. Priority = 3. Status = 33%    <br>
Step 3: Develop algorithm to tally number of characters that participate in conversation at any point during the a particular film and develop visualization of number of speaking characters for all genres. Priority = 1. Status = 0.    <br>
Step 4: Develop algorithm to determine average frequency of speech for films in each genre and develop visualization that compare frequency of speech by characters across genres. Priority = 1. Status = 0.  <br>
Step 5: Develp algorithm to identify main cast and supporting cast (any character not considered to be main cast is considered supporting cast). Priority = 3. Status = 0.     <br>
Step 6: Develop visualization in the form of a constellation graph in d3 between main cast and supporting cast based on frequency of verbal interaction for each genre. Priority = 3. Status = 0.    <br>
Step 7: Visualize the average constellation graph (in d3) between main cast and supporting cast based on frequency of verbal interaction for all included scripts. Priority = 1. Status = 0.   <br>
Step 8: Create a template that display all constellation graphs that demonstrate verbal interaction patterns for each film genre. Priority = 3. Status = 0.    <br>
Step 9: Create a template dropdown menu where user can select individual or multiple constellation graphs that compares the verbal interaction pattern between genres. Priority = 2. Status = 0.    <br>
