# Project Plan Iteration 2

## Sprint 1 Update - Lay the Foundation

My original Sprint 1 goals were to:
  - Figure out which service will be best for me
    - Heroku
    - Flask
    - DigitalOcean
  - Play around in that environment
    - get a test app running (Hello World!)
    - maybe a domain name?
  - Get familiar with the Venmo API
    - how to search, parse, pull all, etc
    - get developer token

As I was late in building ths plan, I'm going to have to roll all of these goals into Sprint 2.  I have been spending some time with the Venmo API, and acquired free credits to DigitalOcean that I plan to check out.  I still haven't made a decision on which to use, and plan to have that figured out this week.

## Sprint 2 Plan - Catching up

I'll now need to fast-track all of my sprint 1 and 2 goals to catch up to pace.  I plan to not cut anything from the final product.

1. Sprint 2: Start pulling in user data
  - Oauth logins
    - build user logins with Venmo Oauth
    - get all data for a user
    - store somehow
      - temporarily, pulling every time?
      - nosql data store?
      - sqlite data store?
  - Preliminary graphs displayed
    - money in/out
    - time of day
    - most commonly used friends
      - facepile?

## Blockers

Nothing so far, as I've just not spent the time to make much progress.  I will update when I come across something that's blocking me.
