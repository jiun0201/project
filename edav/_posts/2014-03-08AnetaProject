Yahoo Data Research
-------------------

Project Description
--------------------

The data source for this project was selected from yahoo and it covered search data for users across various states who searched for athletes and politicians. The data provided by Yahoo Research Labs (YRL) contained locations in various states, athlete or politician users searched for and the host or URL they visited to explore more about their search.
The goal of this project is to analyze this data to understand the degree of interest by users in various states for sports or politics, the most widely visited URL to learn about their subjects, correlation of interests – ex. Search for out-of-state athletes or politicians, and lastly determine to the best possible degree their primary search objective.

Step 1 – Data Exploration and Discovery
----------------------------------------
I explored various data sources and found Yahoo Research Labs (YRL) had a wide variety of data domains. While exploring these domains, I found one of the most interesting data sets on users searching for politicians and athletes in various states in the US. I found this data to be quite uncommon, at the outset two fundamentally distinct areas of interest and was curious to understand the correlations that might exist between these two domains.
Four large data sets in xml formats were obtained from YRL. 

Step 2 – Data Management
------------------------
The following activities were completed to get the data ready for analysis and insights.
1.	Get raw data from YRL
2.	Issues with the provided XML file - Cleansed the XML file and created schema before extracting.
3.	Extracted the dataset using R XML package and loaded it into R.
4.	Created smaller workable data groups and loaded the dataset for statistical analysis into Minitab.

Next step is to explore and identify insights.
