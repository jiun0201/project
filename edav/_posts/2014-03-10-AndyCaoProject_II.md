## Project: Explore Life Insurance Data -- Second Sprint
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### First Sprint Summary

As some fellow classmates mentioned in their updates: cleaning data is harder than we thought. I ran into the same problem with my supposedly "clean" dataset. I received the dataset from an internal source in a tab delimited text file. However, the more I explore the data, the more questions I have. The most serious question being how to handle the missing data. On the extreme, 80% of a very important variable is missing from the file. As a result, I need to with the source to scrap the data from different admin systems that store the data. 

The most frustrated part so far though is learning the programming languages. So far, I've been focusing on learning R, but even simple data manipulations takes a lot of trial and errors. During the first sprint, I spent a lot of time just testing different commands on different variables, and see what the results look like. 

Due to the difficulties mentioned above, so far I only have a few simple plots using qplot command to show for my progress. 



#### Second Sprint Goal:

For the three week period between 3/10 and 3/31, I would like to: 

* Check for missing data, will need to work with the data source to find alternate database that might contain the same information. Once the alternative data sources are identified, will need to wrangle the data into format that's consistent with the original dataset. --ONGOING

* Study some indsutry reports about how this type of data are usually analyzed. -- ONGOING

* Explore mapping functions in R
