### Sprint 1 - Recap:
> I started by wanting to look at the CHSI data set which includes many files with many different health indicators. I spent alot of time reading the data source and definition file to understand the files and columns once I downloaded them. This took me quite some time since I'm new to the dataset and to health indicators in general and I am still learning a lot. I chose to work with the below three datasets within the CSHI dataset, and these will probably become smaller as each file contains alot of information. 
	* Demographics
	* Leading Causes of Death
	* Risk Factors and Access to Care
> I spent some time cleaning each dataset and selecting different columns to explore and have been successful in cutting out a lot of it, but the datasets still need work in cleaning so that I can focus on specific aspects and health indicators and better understand relationships.

### Preliminary visualization
I started trying to play with visualization to explore possible correlations, but obviously this needs alot of work, here is a quick sample:

#### Project plan â€“ Next 3 weeks:
* I will continue to work in cleaning and refining the datasets so that I can better find correlations and relationships in the data. 
* Figure out how to work with the data in a meaningful way and what conclusions can be drawn from the different datasets.
* Continue to explore data and try to visualize results in meaningful way
* Figure out how to make interactive data visualization
