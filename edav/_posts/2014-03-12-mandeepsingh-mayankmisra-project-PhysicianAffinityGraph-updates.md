## Physician Affinity Graph

### Team — Mayank Misra, Mandeep Singh

### Goal — Graph social and professional affiliation for prescribers (doctors). 
We are looking at using publicly available data sets to form a network graph of physicians. 
ML will be used in this context for clustering based on common features/dimensions between physicians.  
The aim is to to establish influencers/opinion leaders and physicians that have the most klout in a particular cluster.
