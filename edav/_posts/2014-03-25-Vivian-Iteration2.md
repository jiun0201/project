# Project Plan Iteration 2

## Sprint 1 Update - Lay the Foundation

My original Sprint 1 goals were to:
  <ul>
    <li>Find data on housing information in SF</li>
    <li>Pull data on Ellis Act evictions</li>
  </ul>

I was able to find and pull data on housing budgets, and the demographic of SF Mission district from the US Census and ACS data. I did some [data exploration](https://github.com/veeps/MissionHousing/tree/master/data/census/R) on the census data, and decided I need to simplify the parameters I'm looking at. Instead of looking at housing prices, I want to look at the demographic make-up of the Mission district, and how it's changed over the years. 

## Sprint 2 Plan 

My thesis is due on April 5, so I would like to have this completed by then. Here is a plan of what I'd like to do:

<ul>
  <li>Select demographic data from Census and ACS data by race/ethnicity.</li>
  <li>Map the data on a map of SF around the Mission District</li>
  <li>I want to generate dots that populate on the map by time</li>

</ul>

Here is a mock-up-- this is just a hypothesis, not based on any data.
