# Detecting Medicare Claim Anomalies

# Part 1 - Data Acquisition and Exploration

## Problem Statement

This analysis is based on the challenge possed by [Cloudera Certified
Professional: Data Scientist
program](http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/training/certification/ccp-
ds/challenge.html) for their graduating candidates.  The probelm statement
states the following:

"In the U.S., Medicare reimburses private providers for medical procedures
performed for covered individuals. As such, it needs to verify that the type of
procedures performed and the cost of those procedures are consistent and
reasonable. Finally, it needs to detect possible errors or fraud in claims for
reimbursement from providers. You have been hired to analyze a large amount of
data from Medicare and try to detect abnormal data -- providers, areas, or
patients with unusual procedures and/or claims."

Although this analysis is not aimed as a repsonce to this challenge, the real
world problem with curated data sources does tempt one to dig a little deeper.
The recent Wall Street Journal article on how [op 1% of medical providers
accounted for 14% of billing](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB100014240527
02303456104579490043350808268?mg=reno64-wsj&url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Far
ticle%2FSB10001424052702303456104579490043350808268.html) peaked my interest to
use the Cloudera use case as the topic for this post.


This post will be a 3 part series.  The firts one will discuss basic data
acquisition and prilimanary exploration of data.
The second will cover Predective Modeling and the last post will communicating
the results using a narrative (story telling) approach.
In this post, I will attempt to extract and explore statistics about the dataset
and present insights on abnormalities in procedur and claim trens.  As a
biproduct, I hope a data exploration and preparation workflow emerges that I can
generalize for use in future analysis.


## Data Acquisition

The following data sources were made available for this challenge.  They
summerize the procedures performed by a physician and the related charges sent
to Medicare for reimbersement.

1.  [Medicare Provider Charge Data: Inpatient](http://www.cms.gov/Research-
Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-
Charge-Data/Inpatient.html)

2.  [Medicare Provider Charge Data: Outpatient](http://www.cms.gov/Research-
Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-
Charge-Data/Outpatient.html)

### Acquier Data

The grainularity of data for Inpatient and Outpatient is the same.  The
difference is in the size of the file.  The Inpatient file has more records as
the the volume of Inpatient procedure is more (which in itself can be an area of
exploration).    For logistical reasons, I have choosen the Outpatient dataset
first. The Outpatient data, (like the Inpatient dataset) is provided in two
bundles:  [Outpatient Charge Data, CY2011, Comma Separated Values (CSV)
version](http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-
Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/Downloads/OPPS_APC_CSV.zip) and
[National and State Summaries of Outpatient Charge Data, CY2011, Comma Separated
Values (CSV) version](http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems
/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-
Data/Downloads/OPPS_NAT_STATE_SUM_CSV.zip).

The compressed zip file was downloaded and extracted locally.  It contains the
following files:

1.  Medicare_Provider_Charge_Outpatient_APC30_CY2011_v2.csv - Size 7MB

2.  Medicare_Charge_Outpatient_APC30_Summary_by_APC_CY2011_v2.csv - Size 2KB

3.  Medicare_Charge_Outpatient_APC30_Summary_by_APCState_CY2011_v2 - Size 107KB

We will start by initializing libraries for iPython Notebook

Initializing requiered iPython libraries

In[81]:

```
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import pandas.tools.rplot as rplot
import pylab as pl
import matplotlib as mpl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

#To be able to embed plots inline in the document
%matplotlib inline 
pd.set_option('display.notebook_repr_html', False)
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', 20)
pd.set_option('display.max_rows', 50)
```

Load data from the source.

The 'readCSV' is a good python/pandas api for interacting with csv or txt files.
A [robust set of libraries](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/io.html)
are avaialble that interact with JSON, SQL and HDFS5 amongst others.

[OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/) is a tool that can be handy for data
cleansing, data exploration, and data transformation.

In[82]:

```
#set data source path
path = '/Users/DataSets/DetectingMedicareClaimAnomalies/DataSet/Extracted/Medicare_Provider_Charge_Outpatient_APC30_CY2011_v2.csv'

header_row = ['APC', 'HCP_Id', 'HCP_Name', 'HCP_St_Add', 'HCP_Add_City', 'HCP_Add_State', 'HCP_Add_Zip_Code', 'Hosp_Ref_Region_Desc', 'OPT_Srvc', 'Avg_Est_Submitted_Charges', 'Avg_Tot_Payments']

#get the data, specify that there are no headers as the default will read first row as headers
getData = pd.read_csv(path, header=True, names=header_row)
```

A good first step is to confirm that the data was read properly.  I usually
check the first and last few rows.  The output usually brings out incorrect,
improperly formatted, incomplete, incorrect, or duplicated records.

In[83]:

```
#confirm data extration
print('These are the first few rows >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> ')
getData.head()
```


    These are the first few rows >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

### Describe Data

#### Explore data statistics

Once I have confirmed that the data is coming in properly and observed its
general structure (string, floats, integrer field), a good second step is to
collect some descriptive satistics ont he dataset as a whole.

Grouping the desriptive statistics by a field you are particularly interested
helps form a general impression about the way that fields trends in the dataset.

In this case the [APC or Ambulatory Payment
Classifications](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulatory_Payment_Classification)
field is a good 'groupby' field.  Note: The APC claims are related to a
Hospitals and reffering hospitals.  Phycisians are remberssed through a
different system.

In[93]:

```
APC_describe = getData.groupby("APC").describe()
APC_describe[:10]
```

#### Visual Exploration of Data

A quick visualization of the loaded data can also provide leads to possible
areas of deeper exploration.  As in this case, we are looking at claim outliers,
we should pay special attention to data that are detached from the primary
clustering.

In[89]:

```
#visually explore the datafrom pandas.tools.plotting import scatter_matrix

pd.scatter_matrix(getData, alpha=0.2, figsize=(8, 8), diagonal='kde')
```




    array([[<matplotlib.axes.AxesSubplot object at 0x15c06d950>,
            <matplotlib.axes.AxesSubplot object at 0x15f40bf10>]], dtype=object)

As is clear from the graphs that infact there is a seperation in the claims.
Most of the claim payments are clustered tightly together while a smaller set
breaks away towards the higher end.  The pattern in the data for HCP_Id and
Avg_Tot_Payment for example, has the approximatly the same trend as the one for
HCP_Add_Zip_Code.  This may imply that trend projected by the grpah is
independent of geography.

Looking at the scatter plots, claims that had and an Avg_Est_Submitted_Charges
above $ 200,00 for which Avg_Tot_Payments were above $ 1500 are another are of
analysis.

A sense of the number of records for the fields one is most interested in can be
derived by ploting them individually.  The graphs below, for example, shows the
APCs with most records are from Cardiac Imaging, MRIs and Cardiovascular
studies.

In[90]:

```
getData.groupby('APC').Avg_Est_Submitted_Charges.sum().plot(kind='barh', color='gold')
```

In[91]:

```
bp = getData.boxplot(column='Avg_Tot_Payments', by='HCP_Add_State', grid=False)
for i in [1,2,3]:
    y = getData.Avg_Tot_Payments[getData.HCP_Add_State==i].dropna()
    # Add some random "jitter" to the x-axis
    x = np.random.normal(i, 0.04, size=len(y))
    pl.plot(x, y, 'r.', alpha=0.2)
```
