Description: Stacks rectangular datasets on top of each other, possibly
    performing several type coercions along the way. For large datasets,
    optionally use the ff package. Provides an aggressive version of
    ffbase::compact for data that may appear be real-typed but is in fact
    int/short/byte. For many purposes plyr::rbind.fill may be more appropriate,
    but for some kinds of survey data, the rules here work better.
