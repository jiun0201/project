))) CSES PROJECT PROFILE
===========================================================================

The Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) is a collaborative
program of research among election study teams from around the world.
Participating countries include a common module of survey questions
in their post-election studies. The resulting data are deposited along
with voting, demographic, district and macro variables. The studies are
then merged into a single, free, public dataset for use in comparative
study and cross-level analysis.

The research agenda, questionnaires, and study design are developed by
an international committee of leading scholars of electoral politics and
political science. The design is implemented in each country by their
foremost social scientists.

By collaborating in this way, the CSES community hopes to forward
scientific inquiry into the relationship between electoral
institutions and political behavior.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CSES MODULE 3 STUDY DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

CSES Module 3 is scheduled to be in use from 2006 through 2011. It is 
based on the stimulus paper by Hermann Schmitt and Bernhard Wessels titled 
"Meaningful Choices: Under what conditions do general elections provide a 
meaningful choice set, and what happens if they don't?"

The Module focuses on voters' perceptions of, assessments of, and responses
to the variety and quality of political choices in an election. It 
considers several aspects of voter perceptions of the choices they are 
offered. The first involves retrospective evaluations of candidates and 
parties. Second, the module incorporates ideology, party image, and policy 
differences between parties as bases for prospective evaluations. Third, 
the module incorporates respondents' summary perceptions of their own 
political choices. The module also provides instrumentation to address the
potential consequences of political choice sets of varying quality.
(excerpted from Burns and McAllister, 2008)

>>> CSES MODULE 3 SECRETARIAT
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

While the CSES project and its governance are international in nature, the
CSES Secretariat for CSES Module 3 was a cooperation between two 
organizations: the Center for Political Studies, Institute for Social 
Research, University of Michigan, United States; and GESIS - Leibniz 
Institute for the Social Sciences, Germany.

Support was received from various sources for the activities of the CSES 
Secretariat during the period of CSES Module 3:

1. American National Science Foundation (NSF) grant SES-0451598, "The 
Comparative Study of Electoral Systems" with Principal Investigators Nancy 
Burns (University of Michigan), Donald Kinder (University of Michigan), and
Ian McAllister (Australian National University), provided support for the 
entire CSES Secretariat from the beginning of CSES Module 3 through 2008.

2. American National Science Foundation (NSF) grant SES-0817701, "The 
Dynamics of Political Choice: the Third Module of the Comparative Study of
Electoral Systems (CSES)" with Principal Investigators Nancy Burns 
(University of Michigan) and Ian McAllister (Australian National 
University), supported CSES Secretariat activities at the University
of Michigan from 2008-2012.

3. American National Science Foundation (NSF) grant SES-1154687, 
"Distributional Politics and Social Protection: the Fourth Module of the
Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES)" with Principal Investigators
Nancy Burns (University of Michigan) and André Blais (University of
Montreal), supported CSES Secretariat activities at the University
of Michigan beginning in 2012.

4. The work by the GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences was 
funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research and 
governments of several German Laender. 

5. The Center for Political Studies at the University of Michigan provided
additional financial support.

Professor Ian McAllister of The Australian National University, and chair
of the CSES Module 3 Planning Committee, oversaw operations of the CSES 
Secretariat through 2009. 

Professor André Blais of the University of Montreal and chair of the 
CSES Module 4 Planning Committee, was responsible for oversight of 
operations through the remainder of CSES Module 3.

Various persons staffed the CSES Secretariat throughout the Module 3
period. David Howell served as the Director of Studies. Matias Bargsted,
Kathrin Busch, Jessica Fortin-Rittberger, Sebastian Netscher, Bojan 
Todosijevic, and Jill Wittrock provided research support, documentation, 
data preparation, and other services. Laurie Winslow served as project 
administrator. Ryan Burton provided information technology support.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> MICRO-LEVEL (SURVEY) COMPONENT
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The core questionnaire ("Module") of CSES Module 3 was intended to be
administered as a single, uninterrupted block of questions in a nationally
representative post-election survey in each country. 

A. The question text is included in the variable documentation of this
codebook. The questions are reported in the order in which they appear in
the CSES questionnaire.

B. Where there are known differences in the way a particular question was
administered in an election study, this is noted in the "Election Study
Notes" following the documentation of the corresponding variable.

C. There are several sets of party and leader evaluation items included
in the module. These correspond to parties labeled A-F, in descending
order of vote share, of the six most popular parties in the lower house
elections (or presidential elections if legislative elections were not
held). Where respondents were asked to evaluate other parties, these
evaluations have been included where possible and are labeled parties
G-I, regardless of their vote shares. The parties and leaders to which
these evaluations apply are identified in Appendix I.

D. There are several questions (including the vote-choice and party
identification items) that ask the respondents to specify a political
party. The codes for these items are also reported in Appendix I.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> DISTRICT-LEVEL COMPONENT
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The district-level variables report the returns of the lower house (first
segment) election for each respondent's district. Wherever possible,
these data were collected from official electoral commissions (see
Bibliography for details). In other cases, CSES has been grateful for the
compilations of these data provided by third-party sources. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> MACRO-LEVEL COMPONENT
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

To supplement the micro (survey) data, the teams of researchers responsible
for the collection of the public opinion data also compiled and deposited 
the following types of data: electoral legislation, political party 
platforms, and official electoral returns.

To facilitate this process, a detailed questionnaire was constructed to 
serve as a framework for the macro component of the project. The Macro Data
Reports, completed by the CSES collaborators, can be found on the CSES
website in the Module 3 section under the "Data Center".

Additional measures thought pertinent to the micro-district-macro design
are also compiled and available in the CSES data files.

A bibliography of the sources consulted during the compilation of macro
data follows the main body of these introductory materials.

))) HOW TO USE THE CSES MODULE 3 DOCUMENTATION
===========================================================================


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> TYPES OF DOCUMENTATION AVAILABLE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are several components to the CSES documentation. Analysts will 
want to become familiar with all of them.

For most election studies, collaborators have provided documentation
to accompany their election studies. These documents, where available,
can be found on the CSES Module 3 download page under "Data Center" on
the CSES website (www.cses.org).

The CSES Module 3 questionnaire is also available from the website or
by referencing the corresponding variables in this codebook.

The codebook consists of three files:

"cses3_codebook_part1_introduction.txt" is the codebook introduction, the 
file you are reading now; it includes an overview of the study and data, 
information about use of the files, general election study descriptions 
and notes, and a bibliography

"cses3_codebook_part2_variables.txt" is the variable descriptions' file, 
including questions, code frames, general notes, and notes specific to 
an election study (by variable)

"cses3_codebook_part3_appendices.txt" contains Appendix I (Parties and 
Leaders) and Appendix II (Primary Electoral Districts)

Analysts will also want to become familiar with the CSES Module 3 errata
page. It is accessible from the CSES Module 3 download page under "Data 
Center" on the CSES website. Information, updates, and error notifications
and corrections are posted there, in real time, as they become available.
Please check regularly for errata notifications to keep up to date.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CODEBOOK CONVENTIONS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the CSES Module 3 dataset, all variables begin with the letter "C".
This convention helps reduce the possibility of overwriting data when
merging with other CSES data sets.

Variables are presented in five groupings:

C1001-C1999 Identification, weight, and election study variables
C2001-C2999 Demographic variables
C3001-C3999 Micro-level (survey) data (the CSES Module 3 questionnaire)
C4001-C4999 District-level data
C5001-C5999 Macro-level data

In the Variable Descriptions portion of the codebook, the headers for
individual variables are surrounded by two lines of dashes. Variable 
names do not exceed eight characters in length.

Most sections of the codebook can be navigated in the electronic
files by searching for the characters ">>>" or ")))" as appropriate.


===========================================================================
))) HOW TO USE THE CSES MODULE 3 DATA FILES
===========================================================================

The CSES Module 3 data files are distributed in a single ZIP file named
"cses3.zip". We recommend that users download this file to their
local computer in a directory named:

c:/cses/module3/20130327/

The last portion of the directory name ("20130327") indicates the version
of the dataset (2013, March 27). This arrangement allows the distributed
files to run without modification, and also sets your files up in a 
way that is well-organized for future distributions of CSES data files.

Within "cses3.zip" are eight (9) files:

"cses3_codebook_part1_introduction.txt" is the codebook introduction file
"cses3_codebook_part2_variables.txt" is the variable descriptions file
"cses3_codebook_part3_appendices.txt" is the codebook appendices file
"cses3.dat" is the raw data file
"readme.txt" is a readme file with information similar to here
"cses3.sas" is the SAS syntax for reading in the raw data
"cses3.sps" is the SPSS syntax for reading in the raw data
"cses3.do" is the STATA do file for reading in the raw data
"cses3.dct" is the STATA dictionary file for reading in the raw data


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> USING CSES MODULE 3 IN SAS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

You need only to execute the SAS syntax file named "cses3.sas". 
This reads the raw data file "cses3.dat" into SAS.
If you downloaded the files to the recommended subdirectory, you 
should be able to execute the file as is and a SAS system file 
will be created in the same subdirectory.

If you are storing any of the files in an alternate location (including
the data file "cses3.dat"), or you want to store the resulting 
SAS system file under a different name or location, you will want to 
modify the SAS files accordingly.

Additional, more detailed instructions are found in the comments section
in the header of the "cses3.sas" file.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> USING CSES MODULE 3 IN SPSS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

You only need only to execute the SPSS syntax file "cses3.sps". 
This reads the raw data file "cses3.dat" into SPSS.
If you downloaded the files to the recommended subdirectory, you 
should be able to execute the file as is and a SPSS system file 
will be created in the same subdirectory.

If you are storing any of the files in an alternate location (including
the data file "cses3.dat"), or you want to store the resulting 
SPSS system file under a different name or location, you will want to 
modify the SPSS files accordingly.

Additional, more detailed instructions are found in the comments section
in the header of the "cses3.sps" file.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> USING CSES MODULE 3 IN STATA
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

You only need to execute the STATA "do" file "cses3.do". 
This, in combination with the STATA dictionary file "cses3.dct", reads the
raw data file "cses3.dat" into STATA
If you downloaded the files to the recommended subdirectory, you 
should be able to execute the file as is and a STATA system file 
will be created in the same subdirectory.

If you are storing any of the files in an alternate location (including
the data file "cses3.dat" and the dictionary file "cses3.dct"), or you want
to store the resulting STATA system file under a different name or 
location, you will want to  modify the STATA files accordingly.

===========================================================================
))) SPECIAL DATA NOTES
===========================================================================


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> IDENTIFICATION VARIABLES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each record in CSES Module 3 contains two key identification variables.

The first is ELECTION STUDY, which uniquely identifies an election study
across time. It appears in two variations:

    C1003 "ID VARIABLE - ELECTION STUDY (NUMERIC POLITY)"
    C1004 "ID VARIABLE - ELECTION STUDY (ALPHABETIC POLITY)"

The second is RESPONDENT, which uniquely identifies a respondent across
time:

    C1005 "ID VARIABLE - RESPONDENT"

Notes on their creation and use are available in the variable descriptions
portion of the codebook.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> MISSING DATA
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Researchers should be aware that sometimes there are multiple response
categories included in the code "missing" (the code "missing" is usually
indicated with a last digit of 9). For some election studies in which we
could not distinguish among various answers, the code "missing"
may include cases where respondents refused to answer the question,
"don't know" responses, and cases where there a particular question went
unanswered for other reasons.

(2) While CSES guidelines request that the response categories "Refused"
and "Don't Know" be volunteered responses, this was not always consistently
applied. For instance, sometimes the options were offered explicitly to
respondents in mail-back surveys, which do not have the benefit of an
interviewer being present. To identify whether the response options were
volunteered (or not) in a particular election study, please refer to the
original questionnaire provided by the collaborator. The original
questionnaires, where available, are accessible from the CSES Module 3
download page under "Data Center" on the CSES website.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> WEIGHTS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because of the variance in the sample designs used in the election studies
included in this project, the weights provided by the collaborators also
vary greatly. They are described in detail in variables C1010-C1014.
Analysts are advised to read the weight documentation carefully to ensure
that their analyses are weighted appropriately.

The original weights provided by the collaborators, where available, are:

    C1010_1  >>> ORIGINAL WEIGHT: SAMPLE
    C1010_2  >>> ORIGINAL WEIGHT: DEMOGRAPHIC
    C1010_3  >>> ORIGINAL WEIGHT: POLITICAL

The remainder of the weight variables in the dataset are derivative
variables, constructed from the original weights;

    C1011_1  >>> FACTOR: MEAN OF SAMPLE WEIGHT
    C1011_2  >>> FACTOR: MEAN OF DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT
    C1011_3  >>> FACTOR: MEAN OF POLITICAL WEIGHT
    C1012_1  >>> POLITY WEIGHT: SAMPLE
    C1012_2  >>> POLITY WEIGHT: DEMOGRAPHIC
    C1012_3  >>> POLITY WEIGHT: POLITICAL
    C1013    >>> FACTOR: SAMPLE SIZE ADJUSTMENT
    C1014_1  >>> DATASET WEIGHT: SAMPLE
    C1014_2  >>> DATASET WEIGHT: DEMOGRAPHIC
    C1014_3  >>> DATASET WEIGHT: POLITICAL

The STATA code used to create the derivative weights can be found as 
variable notes in the codebook documentation for the derivative weight
variables.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> FREEDOM STATUS OF ELECTIONS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The majority of studies that comprise CSES are collected in countries that
have free or partly free elections. However, sometimes a collaborator will
include the CSES module in a study of a country that is a developing
democracy or that is considered not free. If the data collection is judged
to be of sufficiently high quality, the study is included in CSES datasets
even if the country is considered to be not free. The decision is left to
individual users as to whether such countries should be included in their
analyses of CSES datasets.

The CSES Module 3 dataset includes freedom ratings from Freedom House, 
whose website as of this dataset release is: http://www.freedomhouse.org/

Freedom House is not affiliated with the CSES project.

>>> OTHER ELECTION STUDIES INCLUDING CSES MODULE 3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following studies collected CSES data during the CSES Module 3 field
period, but were unable to be included in the CSES Module 3 Full Release
for the listed reasons. We are highlighting the studies here to promote
their efforts, and as a service to CSES users who might wish to contact
the collaborators directly to inquire about obtaining the data for use in
their own analyses.

If you are interested in obtaining these data, please contact the listed
collaborators directly. CSES is unable to distribute or support the files.

- Denmark (2007 Internet Study)

CSES collaborators Jørgen Goul Andersen, Rune Stubager, and Kasper Møller
Hansen ran two election studies in Denmark after the 2007 election. 

The first election study, a mixed mode survey, included 1,442 completions
and appears in the CSES Module 3 Full Release dataset.

The second election study, collected on the Internet, does not appear
in the CSES Module 3 Full Release dataset. While preliminary research 
indicated that the web panel might have used probability-based sampling,
this could not be verified by the CSES Secretariat staff members with
certainty prior to the dissemination of the CSES Module 3 Full Release.
The Denmark (2007) Internet Study was run on the Internet panel named
Gallup@Forum. The Denmark (2007) Design Report indicates that the 
Gallup@Forum Internet panel consisted of 45,000 Danes at the age of 15
and above. The Design Report went on to describe that the sample was
stratified by sex * age, region, and education, and consisted of 
6,100 individuals, of which 2,576 persons completed an interview via
the Internet.

- Great Britain (2010 Internet Study)

The British Election Study (BES), under the direction of Principal
Investigators Harold D. Clarke, David Sanders, Marianne C. Stewart, and
Paul Whiteley, included CSES Module 3 in a Internet survey run by YouGov
after the 2010 election in Great Britain. A total of 927 interviews were
collected. As of publication time, the dataset was publicly available from
the BES website at address: http://bes2009-10.org/

The BES survey that included CSES Module 3 drew respondents from a panel
built using a non-probability sample, not a probability sample, and thus
the study was unable to be included in the CSES Module 3 Full Release.

))) ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES
===========================================================================

The following section provides:

(1) General information about the election after which the CSES Module 3 
was administered. In several cases, the election followed the establishment
of new electoral rules. In several others, the election marks a dramatic
change in government. This information is provided with the intention of
alerting the analyst to interesting features of the election. For more
details, please refer to the Macro Reports prepared by the collaborators,
available on the CSES website.

(2) General information about the research and sample designs of the
component election studies. For example, in some cases, the CSES module was
administered in a later wave of a multi-wave study. Additionally, in
several countries, portions of the population were excluded from the sample
frame, usually because of geographic isolation.

(3) Additional information on survey weights, where available, is provided
for some election studies.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - AUSTRALIA (2007)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) On 14 October 2007, Prime Minister John Howard called elections for 24 
November. At stake were all 150 seats in the House of Representatives, and 
40 of the 76 seats in the Senate. 

The 2007 elections saw once again a duel between the Liberal Party and the 
ALP. Prime Minister Howard (Liberal Party) was seeking a fifth consecutive 
term in office. Prime Minister Howard urged voters to support his party for 
further economic growth. The Liberal leader insisted that the country should
maintain its 1,500 troops in Iraq and 1,000 in Afghanistan as long as 
needed, and maintain a close alliance with the U.S. The ALP leader argued
that 550 combat troops should be withdrawn from Iraq by mid-2008, while 
more troops should be sent to Afghanistan. Prime Minister Howard continued
to oppose the Kyoto Protocol on climate change and its carbon emission 
targets, arguing they would damage the country's economy. Mr. Rudd promised
to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and pledged to cut carbon emissions by 60 per
cent by 2050. In 2007, Australia suffered its worst drought in 100 years.
Global warming was reportedly a major concern for many citizens. 

During the election campaign, the Liberal Party was damaged by two 
incidents. On 7 November, the Reserve Bank raised interest rates to 6.75
per cent, the sixth increase since the 2004 elections, when Prime Minister 
Howard had promised to keep the interest rate low. Two days before the 
polling day, further controversy was caused by leaflets circulated in 
Sydney by volunteers and members of the Liberal Party, which linked the ALP
to Muslim extremists. The Prime Minister condemned the act and emphasized
he had not authorized the leaflets. 

The final results gave a major victory to the ALP, which won 83 seats in 
the House of Representatives, while the Liberal Party took 55. Howard
became the first incumbent prime minister to be voted out since Mr. Stanley
Bruce in 1929. In the Senate elections, the ALP won 18 seats, controlling 
32 seats in all. The Liberal Party won 15 seats and also holds 32 seats in
all.

(2) The CSES Module was included in the Australian Post-Election Study, 
running from November 23, 2007 until March 14, 2008 as a self-completion 
supplement by mail. Because of this chosen mode of survey, interviewers 
were not employed. The sample of the survey was restricted to persons 
aged 18 or older being registered as voters. No social group such as 
institutionalized persons and military personnel were excluded from 
sampling. The sampling procedure itself was a stratified systematic 
random sampling. Electors were drawn from the Commonwealth Electoral Roll 
by the Australian Electoral Commission, following the close of rolls for 
the 2007 election. The sample was selected to be proportional to the 
population, on a state by state basis. The entire electorate was randomly 
selected, therefore involving no further stages of selection, or any kind
of stratification, clustering or quota sampling. On average, selected 
persons have been contacted three times. 

(3) The original data, provided by Australia, did not include any kind of
weights. Furthermore, due to the sample procedure, weights were not 
necessary to make the sample representative for the whole Australian 
population.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - AUSTRIA (2008)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Elections were held on 28 September 2008 for all the seats in the 
National Council following premature dissolution of this body on 9 July 
2008. Elections to the National Council had previously taken place on 1 
October, 2006. The collapse of the coalition government in July 2008 
triggered early elections to the 183-member National Council in September, 
nearly 25  months before they were due. 

Inflation and high fuel prices reportedly disrupted the country's economy
prior to the 2008 elections. 

Following a reform of the electoral law in 2007, the voting age was 
lowered from 18 to 16 years, and people over 18 years of age (instead
of 19) became eligible to run for elections to the National Council. 
In the same vein, the term of the National Council was extended from four
to five years starting from the new legislature. 

Both the SPÖ and the ÖVP recorded their worst results since World War II.
They won 57 and 51 seats respectively. On the contrary, the FPÖ and the
BZÖ increased their strength to 34 and 21 seats respectively. The Greens
took the remaining 20 seats. In all 50 women were elected. 

On 8 October, President Heinz Fischer (SPÖ) asked Mr. Faymann (SPÖ) to 
form a new government. The newly elected National Council held its first 
session on 28 October and re-elected Ms. Barbara Prammer (SPÖ) as its 
Speaker. On 2 December, Mr. Faymann's government comprising the SPÖ and the
ÖVP was sworn in by President Fischer.

(Source: PARLINE database: http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/parline.htm) 

(2) The sample is meant to be representative of the Austrian Population, 
persons aged 17 and older, all persons eligible to vote for the national
election 2008. 

The sample was drawn using multiple stratification with a clustered 
address random procedure:
a. Austria was divided into nine provinces proportional to their 
population (age 17 and above)
b. These provinces were then divided in 121 administrative districts, 
again proportional to their population,
c. These districts were finally divided in 9 different town sizes.
d. Communities were then randomly selected, and within each community a 
PAC (post-certified address code) and then 5 addresses, again randomly.
e. The Kish Method was used to reach younger people in each household.

The sampling frame for stratification is based on census data provided by
Statistics Austria; the selection of households is based on the Austrian
telephone book (Österreichische Post AG).
Every interviewer was given a second address in case the target respondent
was not contactable or the address was not correct. Only then could the 
second address be used. A postcard was sent to potential respondents prior
to the study.

Note that although the survey organization had been requested 
to interview only Austrian citizens who are eligible to vote, some 38 
non-citizens were first included in the sample. All of those have been
removed from the final sample.

(3) A demographic sample weight is included that adjusts sample 
characteristics to those of the population. The sample selection procedure
was designed to ensure random sampling at the last stage. Because of non-
response the sample is not an exact representation in terms of equal 
distribution of the known demographic characteristics of the Austrian 
population. Hence weights are used to adapt to those known distributions.

The weighting was computed as follows.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - BELARUS (2008)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) On 24 June 2008, President Alexander Lukashenko issued a presidential
decree calling elections to the House of Representatives on 28 September.
A total of 263 candidates and eight parties contested the 2008 elections. 

The United Democratic Force, the opposition coalition formed during the 
2006 presidential elections, remained the main opposition force
in 2008. In August 2008, former Hramada leader, Mr. Alexander
Kozulin who had been sentenced to five and a half years' imprisonment in
2006 after staging a protest against President Lukashenko was released 
from prison. In mid August, five UCP candidates in the capital Minsk 
announced that they would withdraw from the elections, citing obstacles 
encountered in their campaigning. On 30 August, the BPF, which had seen 
the candidatures of its two deputy chairmen rejected, announced that the 
party would withdraw all its candidates before polling day, criticizing 
the "undemocratic nature" of the elections. The government stated that the
electoral process was 'open and transparent'. The candidature of the 
leader of an unregistered opposition coalition, the European Coalition,
Mr. Mikalay Statkevich, was rejected in a Supreme Court ruling of 9 
September due to a previous conviction for unauthorized demonstrations
against the results of the 2004 parliamentary elections. 

The Organisation for Security and Co operation in Europe (OSCE) and the 
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) sent 465 and 368 observers 
respectively to monitor the polls. The OSCE declared that the elections
fell short of OSCE commitments for democratic elections. However, it noted 
some improvements such as the slightly increased access of opposition 
representatives to election commissions and the decision to allow fairer
access for all candidates to prime time television..It nevertheless 
criticized a "barely visible election campaign", which it deemed to be 
strictly controlled by the government. The CIS and the Central Election
Commission said the elections had been "free and open". 

Final results gave six seats to the Communist Party and one to the Agrarian
Party. In all, 30 outgoing members were returned. Other elected candidates 
included 32 managers of State owned companies and institutions, and 17
State officials. No opposition members were elected. The UCP rejected the
election results.

(2) The CSES module was implemented between February 2 2009 and February
24 2009, following the September 28 legislative elections. The mode of 
interview was face to face. The sample frame covered the totality of the
population of the Republic of Belarus 18 years or older and did not exclude
non-citizens, non-registered voters, institutionalized people or military
personnel. The exact percentage of eligible population excluded from the
sample frame is not available. Multi-stage stratified sampling was used in
the research. The territorial principle of the sample design underlies the 
choice, in accordance with which the selection is realized through a number
of stages (5 in total). At every stage different territorial units are
used: larger ones - at the initial stage; the observation unit corresponds
to the selection unit. At the first stage the stratification of the primary
selection units was realized across all the six administrative territorial
district of the Republic of Belarus. Urban settlements are grouped
according to the number of dwellers, 4 strata were formed. Rural
settlements are grouped according to the regions of each administrative
district of the country. Settlements for the survey were selected by
probability, proportional to the number of people residing there. In total 
60 settlements were included into the sample. At the second stage a method
of random sampling without replacement was applied to select the streets in
the settlements. At further stages the route modeling method was used to
perform the selection. At the third stage, the unit of selection is the 
house, then at the fourth stage, the unit of selection is the household. At
the final stage of the respondent selection the method of the «closest 
birth date» was applied and a single respondent was selected. Urban 
settlements and rural administrative districts were used as primary 
sampling units (PSU), and these were selected by means of random sampling
without replacement. The sample design did not involve clustering at any
stage, or quota sampling. Substitution was permitted if the respondent who
got into the sample refused to take part in the interview, or if after 
three visits the respondent was not reached. The response rate was 50,5%.
The sample contains 2494 households for 1000 valid interviews.

(3) There is no weight variable in this election study given that weights
are not necessary to make the population under study representative of 
the general population of Belarus.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - BRAZIL (2006)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) On 1 October 2006, parliamentary elections were held for all 513 seats
in the Chamber of Deputies and for 27 seats in the Senate, concurrently 
with presidential elections. 

In June 2005, the government was weakened by corruption scandals involving
campaign donations by the PT to coalition partners. President da Silva, 
who had been elected on an anti-corruption platform, publicly apologized
to his fellow citizens in August 2005. In the 2006 election campaign, 
President da Silva argued that his government had helped millions of poor
Brazilians to join the middle class, and insisted on the necessary 
co-existence of social and economic policy. The main opposition parties,
the PSDB and the PFL, formed an electoral coalition. The PSDB camp 
presented more liberal policies that included the promotion of free trade
agreements, in particular with the United States. The PFL did not field a
presidential candidate, while the PSDB endorsed the former governor of
Sao Paulo, Mr. Geraldo Alckmin, who pledged to enhance the country's
economy by fighting corruption. 

The PMDB became the largest party in the Chamber of Deputies, winning 89
seats, followed by the PT with 83 and the PSDB with 66 seats. The PFL lost 
33 seats, retaining 65. It nevertheless remained the largest party in the
Senate, winning six seats in the 2006 partial elections, to control 18 
seats in total. President da Silva was re-elected with more than 60 per 
cent of the votes in a run-off election on 29 October.

(2) The CSES module was implemented in a face-to-face post-election survey 
between December 17, 2006 and December 27, 2006. The questionnaire was 
translated in Portuguese by the national survey team. The sample includes
persons aged 16 or older with Brazilian citizenship. The study employs a 
three stage stratified probability sample of Brazilian adults. In the first
stage, 79 primary sampling units (PSU), or municipals, were selected with 
probability proportional to size (PPS). In the second stage, 100 secondary 
units (census tracts) were selected PPS within each of the PSUs. In the 
third stage, the households were selected within census tracts with one 
adult respondent being selected by quota by age, sex, education level, 
working/not working population, according to 2003 PNAD (IBGE). 

Note that the electoral districts in Brazil overlap with state
boundaries, with the exception of one: the Federal District. For 
procedural reasons, five electoral districts in the region North 
(Acre, Amapa, Rondonia, Roraima) and Center (Tocantins) were left
out of the data sampling procedure. According to the National
Household Survey PNAD2003 these 5 states represent 2% of the
population.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - BRAZIL (2010)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) The 2010 elections were the first to be held since electoral 
amendments intended to promote women's political participation. Among other
things, parties must allocate at least 30 per cent of their parliamentary 
candidatures to women. At stake were all 513 seats in the Chamber of 
Deputies and two thirds of the 81 seats in the Senate (54 seats). The 
parliamentary elections were held in parallel with the presidential 
elections.

In 2010, for the first time since the end of military rule in 1985, 
President Lula was not a presidential candidate. He was constitutionally
barred from seeking a third consecutive term. The international media 
focused on the presidential election, paying only secondary attention to 
the parliamentary polls. The PT pledged to continue the "My Home, My Life"
(Minha Casa, Minha Vida) programme, which aims to provide up to 3 million
new homes to low-income  families and single mothers. Ms. Rousseff, who was
keen to become the country's first female President, pledged to carry on
President Lula's policies in order to continue to provide stability and
prosperity to all Brazilians.

The PT was challenged by the PSDB. The PSDB promised to lead a pro-business 
government and increase the minimum wage from R$ 500 (US$ 300) to R$ 600 
(US$ 360) starting from 2011. The PSDB's coalition partner, the DEM, 
endorsed Mr. Indio da Costa (DEM) as Mr. Serra's running mate (in March 
2007, the PFL renamed itself The Democrats - DEM). Mr. Costa had 
co-sponsored the "clean record" (ficha limpa) bill, toughening the 
eligibility requirements for public office. Candidates who are found guilty
of committing electoral violations and crimes involving the use of public 
funds are barred from running for office for eight years. President Lula 
signed the bill into law on 4 June 2010.

The left-wing parties, including the PT and the PSB, gained 310 of the 513
seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 50 of the 81 seats in the Senate. The
opposition parties, including the PSDB and the DEM, took 138 seats in the
Chamber of Deputies and 24 seats in the Senate. On 31 October, in the 
run-off presidential elections, Ms. Rousseff (PT) triumphed over Mr. Serra
(PSDB), thereby becoming the first female President of Brazil.

(2) The CSES module was implemented in a face-to-face post-election survey 
between November 4, 2010 and November 20, 2010. 

The questionnaire was translated in Portuguese and pre-tested by the 
national survey team. There were 27 different versions of the questionnaire
filled with different names of local politicians (governors, senators) for 
each state of federation.

The sample includes persons aged 16 or older with Brazilian citizenship. 
The study employs a three stage stratified probability sample of Brazilian 
adults. 

In the first stage, 149 primary sampling units (PSU), or municipals, were 
selected probability proportional to size (PPS). Each PSU consists of a 
single municipals as defined by IBGE. For the 2009 Projeção da População, 
IBGE divided Brazil into 5 census region with 27 states and 5566 
municipals. In the second stage, 500 secondary units (census tracts) were 
selected PPS within each of the PSUs. In the third stage, the households 
were selected within census tracts with one adult respondent being selected
by quota by situação (urban/rural) age, sex, education level, working/not 
working population, according to 2008 PNAD (IBGE).
The interviewer has specific procedures to complete the quotas: in sum, the
interviewer enumerates the blocs within census tracts, walks the blocs 
oriented by hour direction, and at each three households he runs the 
interview. Inside the household the quotas are applied to choose the 
respondent. These procedures allow checking the interviews and limit the
interviewer to run the interviews within the selected census tract.

The sample design included stratification based on administrative division.
Brazil is divided in 5 administrative regions. The population distribution 
is the following, according to 2009 Population Estimation: North: 8,0%; 
Northeast: 28,0%; Southeast: 42,3%; South: 14,5%; Center-west: 7,2%.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - CANADA (2008):
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) On 7 September 2008 Prime Minister Stephen Harper asked Governor 
General Michaëlle Jean to dissolve Parliament and call new elections to the
House of Commons for 14 October. This would be the third elections in four 
years. According to an amendment to the Elections Act in November 2006 
elections were not due until 19 October 2009. However the amendment did not
divest the Governor General of the power to dissolve parliament before the 
end of its term. Prime Minister Harper used this legal loophole to call for
early elections in a bid to secure a parliamentary majority arguing that 
the parliament was "dysfunctional". In all 1 601 candidates including 445 
women were vying for the 308 seats at stake. 

Although no specific issues dominated the political agenda at the time of 
the dissolution the global financial crisis pushed the economy to the 
forefront of the election campaign. Major parties presented various tax-
reduction plans to boost the economy trying to win over the provinces of 
Ontario and Québec which account for a total of 181 out of the 308 seats in
the House of Commons. The campaign was also dominated by Canada's ongoing
involvement in the war in Afghanistan. 

The final results gave 143 seats to the Conservative Party. The Liberal 
Party's share dropped to 76. The Bloc Québécois remained the third largest
party with 50 seats. The New Democrats increased its strength to 37.

(2) Interviewing for the campaign study (CPS) began on September 26, 2008.
Excepting the first day of calling and Thanksgiving Day (October 10), 
between 130 and 260 interviews were completed each day until midnight of 
the evening before the October 14 election. In total 3,257 CPS interviews 
were completed. The sample for the post-election surveys was comprised of 
respondents to the CPS. For the 2008 survey this included not only the new
2008 RDD sample (n = 2,451) but also the 2006 panel sample (n = 1,238). At
the end of the CPS in 2008, as in 2006, the interviewer ensured that they
had a first name or some other identifier (such as  respondent's position 
in the household, e.g., mother). This information, as well as the sex and 
year of birth of the CPS respondent, and the respondent's telephone number,
was recorded on a cover sheet. The interviewer called and asked for the 
person by name or identifier. If there was any concern about reaching the 
correct person the interviewer also checked age and gender. Calling for 
the post-election study (PES) started on October 15 the day after vote and
all of the campaign respondents were called back within three days of the 
vote. After 10 days of calling 50 percent of the PES interviews were 
completed. By day 20 almost 70 percent of the interviews were completed but
mall numbers of interviews were completed until late December 23. In total 
3,689 PES interviews were completed of which 2,451 were from the new 2008 
CPS and the remaining 1,238 were respondents who  were interviewed in the 
2006 CPS. Many of the panel respondents were also interviewed in the 2006 
PES and a small number were interviewed in 2004 but not 2006. At the end of
the post-election survey, respondents were asked to provide their address 
so they could be sent the mail-back survey. Mail-back information was 
provided by 76 percent of the PES respondents. 

The sample for the CPS was designed to represent the adult population of
Canada: Canadian citizens 18 years of age or older who speak one of
Canada's official languages, English or French, and reside in private homes
in the ten Canadian provinces (thus excluding the territories). Because
the survey was conducted by telephone, the small proportion of households
in Canada without telephones were excluded from the sample population. 
Residents of old age homes, group homes, and educational and penal
institutions were excluded from the sample (about 0.3%).

To select individual survey respondents for the CPS, a two-stage 
probability selection process was utilized. The first stage involved the 
selection of households by randomly selecting telephone numbers. The second
stage of the sample selection process was the random selection of a 
respondent from the selected household. To be eligible for the interview 
the household member had to be an adult (18 years of age or older) and a 
Canadian citizen. If there was more than one eligible person in the 
household, the person with the next birthday was selected as the survey 
respondent. The design of the CES included a longitudinal component as the
CPS respondents were asked to complete the PES and respondents to the PES 
were asked to complete the MBS. There was no substitution of respondents 
for those who declined to participate in the second or third wave of the 
study. The number of completed interviews, the sample size, for the three 
studies was 4,323, 3,138 and 1,674 respectively. The response rate to the 
CPS was 55 percent and the re-interview rate for the PES was 73 percent and
53 percent of the PES respondents (representing 39 percent of the CPS 
respondents) completed the MBS.

(3) In order to produce national estimates it is advisable to correct for
both the unequal probabilities of selection at the household stage and the
unequal probabilities of selection based on province of residence. The
included sample weight (C1010_1) represents the original National Weight,
constructed as the product of the household weight and the provincial
weight and should be used with the National Sample when national estimates
are required. The household weight compensates for the higher probability
of households with smaller number of adults to be included in the sample.
The Provincial weight compensates for over representation of the eight
smaller provinces and a corresponding under-representation reduction in
Ontario and Quebec.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) The 2009 parliamentary and presidential elections were the first to be
held since the death of Augusto Pinochet, the country's dictator between
1973 and 1990. The centre-left Coalition for Democracy (CPD) had led the
country since 1990. 

In the Chamber of Deputies, the CC won 58 seats, one more than the CPD.
Clean Chile-Vote Happy and the Pactfree Independents took three and two
seats respectively. In the Senate, the CC and the CPD took nine seats each
out of the 18 seats at stake. However, the CPD remained the largest force
in the Senate with 19 seats, the CC holding 16. Mr. Pinochet failed to win 
the seat he was contesting, receiving only 10 per cent of the votes, far
less than the two CC candidates, who were elected with over 30 per cent
of the vote each.

(2) The Election Study was conducted between December 26th, 2009 and
January, 7th, 2010 as a post-election study using face-to-face interviews.
The sample frame included citizens eligible to vote, in continental Chile.
It is thus meant to be representative of around 95% of the population.
The sample was drawn as a random sample but a quota concerning age, sex and
active/inactive was applied, using the proportions of the population of the
electoral district. The sampling was done in three stages: a) Random
selection of Primary Selection Units (of 2000 inhabitants each) from the
whole country. B)Random selection of households with routes within the map
of the 2000 inhabitants. C) Random selection of the interviewee - the last
person to have had birthday (who is at least 18 years old). 

(3) The study has a multiplicative weight variable designed to match the
distribution of sex, education and age in the Chilean population as
measured by the latest census.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) On 12 October 2007, the parliament voted to dissolve itself in view of 
elections due in November 2007. President Stjepan Mesic subsequently called 
elections for 25 November. A total of 3,585 candidates from 251 lists 
(parties and coalitions) ran for the 2007 elections. 

The 2007 elections saw once again a duel between Prime Minister Ivo 
Sanader's HDZ, and the SDP of Mr. Zoran Milanovic. The main issues were 
economic policy and the country's accession to the European Union (EU) and 
NATO. Both parties were favourable to accede to the EU before 2010. While 
the HDZ pledged to accelerate the accession process, the SDP argued the 
conditions of accession were more important than speed. Prime Minister 
Sanader advocated a liberal economy with less state involvement. The SDP
insisted on more state control over the economy. The HDZ had strong support
from Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina who are eligible to vote. The SDP
vowed to strip Bosnian Croats of the right to vote in Croatian elections
if it was elected to office. 

The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) praised the
elections for being transparently and professionally administered. It 
declared that they "represented further progress in fully meeting OSCE 
commitments for democratic elections". The final results gave 66 seats to
the ruling HDZ. The SDP came in second with 56 seats. Both the HDZ and SDP
leaders claimed the right to form a government.

(2) The CSES was implemented between March 10, 2008 and April 3, 2008 as a
post-election study in face-to-face interviews. The sample of origin 
included 2060 persons aged 18 years and older living in Croatia.
The selection process was a two-way stratified multistage sampling. 
Stratification was performed by region and settlement size (including four
groups: up to 2.000 inhabitants, 2.001-10.000 inhabitants, 10.001-100.000 
inhabitants, more than 100.000 inhabitants). Within each stratum, 
settlements were chosen with probability proportionate to size, according 
to the size of population, based on Croatian Census data of 2001. That 
implies random selection of settlement with population less than 2000, 
while the largest cities in all regions are mandatory part of the sample. 

The household within the chosen settlements was selected using "random 
starting point method" and "random walk method". Finally, within the 
household the concert respondent was selected using the Troldahl-Carter-
Bryant method. 

The sample selection process excluded institutionalized persons in health 
care and elderly care institutes, in religious organizations and so on. 
Military personnel were excluded as long as they live in military 
barracks, but not if they live in private households. Moreover, people with
visual and hearing disabilities were excluded generally. In total about 
0.7% of the overall population (aged 18 upwards) were not part of the
sampling frame. The total amount of completed interviews in the sample are 
1004 respondents.

(3) The Croatian data includes two different weights, to control a) for the 
demographic marginal (region, settlement, size, sex, age, education) and b) 
to controls for the political marginal (region, settlement, size, sex, age, 
education) according to the election results. Both weights were 
calculated on the basis of the Croatian Census data of 2001.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) The 2006 elections were the first parliamentary elections since the
country's accession to the European Union (EU) in May 2004. Close to 5,000
candidates and 26 political groups contested the 2006 elections. 

The pro-EU CSSD formed an electoral coalition with the Communist Party of 
Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM) pledging to preserve a welfare state policy by
raising pensions and the minimum wage while aiming to introduce the euro
as the national currency in 2010. The Civic Democratic Party (ODS) led by
Mr. Mirek Topolanek formed an electoral coalition with the KDU-CSL and the
Greens (SZ). It favoured a more liberal economy while taking a more 
cautious approach to the euro. It pledged to introduce a flat 15 per cent
rate for income tax and VAT and to abolish all other taxes. 

The elections ended in political deadlock with both coalitions winning 
exactly 100 seats. The ODS as the largest party with 81 seats was given 
a mandate to form a government. The newly-elected Chamber of Deputies was
adjourned on several occasions due to disputes over the election of its
new speaker and amid ongoing discussions about the formation of a new 
government.

(2) The election study is a post-election study that began on 9th June 2006
and ended on 21th June, 2006. It was conducted face-to-face and was not 
part of a panel study. As a sampling method, quota sampling was used. 
Quotas were designed for each region (14 regions) based on age, sex and 
education, and the size of municipality. If a person refused to take part 
in interview, another person suitable to the quota was selected.

There were around 900 interviewers in the CVVM polling agency all around
the country. They were both men and women almost in the same ratio. Age 
varied in between 18 to 65 years with the average age 38 years. Education
structure of interviewers is 80 % secondary school and 20 % university 
level. The experience with CVVM polling agency varied between 1 to 21 
years. Average interviewer worked for CVVM 12 years.

Before a person becomes an interviewer of CVVM s/he has to go through 
training where principles of interviewing and the administration around 
interviewing (filling the questionnaires, correspondence with public 
opinion headquarters etc.) are learned. After the training, the person 
goes through test interviews. Training of interviewers after becoming an 
interviewer of CVVM is organized  every 5 years. There is a training letter
for interviewers added to every questionnaire/survey and almost non-stop 
phone and e-mail consultations.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - CZECH REPUBLIC (2010)
=============================================================================

(1) In January 2009, the Czech Republic took over the EU Presidency. However, 
in the middle of its term, on 24 March 2009, the Government lost a vote of
non-confidence. It was the first time in the Czech Republic's history that
the opposition succeeded in passing a non-confidence motion against the
government. On 5 February 2010, President Václav Klaus set elections to 
the Chamber of Deputies for 28 and 29 May 2010. 

Early elections required a constitutional amendment, which President Klaus
signed into law in September after its adoption by the Senate. However,
several members of the Chamber of Deputies opposed the amendment, arguing
that they had the right to serve the full four-year term. Later in the same
month, the CSSD, the KSCM and the SZ voted against the Chamber's dissolution.
Consequently, the elections were held on 28 and 29 May 2010, a few days
before the term of outgoing members expired (on 2 June). The mandate of the
caretaker government was extended until the new elections. 

The 2010 elections were held against the backdrop of the Greek and
euro-zone crises. The dominant theme during the campaign in the Czech
Republic was how to deal with the country's public deficit. 

The final result of the polls was another stalemate with no party securing a
majority in the Chamber of Deputies. Both major parties ended up with fewer
seats than in the outgoing legislature. The CSSD came in first with 56 seats
(down from 74), narrowly followed by the ODS, which took 53 seats (down from
81). The KSCM took 26 seats. 

The KDU-CSL failed to win any seats in the Chamber of Deputies for the first
time since the Czech Republic was founded in 1993, prompting its leader, Mr.
Cyril Svoboda, to resign. The SZ also failed to retain its representation in
the Chamber of Deputies. CSSD leader Paroubek took responsibility for his
party's defeat and announced his resignation as well.

(1) On 24 October 2007 Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen called early
elections to the 179-member Danish Parliament (Folketing) for 13 November 
ahead of the official end of the four-year term in February 2009.

In the 2007 elections Prime Minister Rasmussen was seeking a third 
consecutive term in office. A total of 808 candidates representing nine
parties and including 12 independents contested the 2007 elections. 

Tax welfare and immigration were main issues during the election campaign. 
Prime Minister Rasmussen pledged to implement further tax-cutting measures 
referring to his government's proposal to lower income tax which was passed
in parliament on 23 October. The Social Democrat leader Thorning-Schmidt 
promised to provide better welfare including higher wages for the lowest-
paid public servants. Prime Minister Rasmussen also promised to soften 
asylum laws proposing that asylum seekers with families be housed outside
reception centres. The  Social Democratic Party suggested that rejected 
asylum seekers be allowed to work in Denmark. The New Alliance a new
centrist party formed in May  2007 and led by Mr. Naser Khader a 
Syrian-born Palestinian immigrant also promised to work towards better
treatment of refugees. The Danish People's Party led by Ms. Pia 
Kjaersgaard opposed all initiatives to soften asylum laws. 

The final results gave the outgoing coalition and its supporters a total of
89 seats. The Social Democratic Party took 45 seats. The New Alliance 
finally won 2.8 per cent of the votes or five seats.

(2) The 1442 Danish respondents were interviewed in person or through self-
administrated interviews (postal and internet). A number of address
clusters were drawn from the Ministry of the Interior. These clusters were
divided based on population density. Each cluster consisted of 4-12 
addresses. A total of approximately 600 addresses were drawn (sampling 
points). The addresses were merged with a database consisting of 2.5 
million landline phone numbers, as well as 2.1 million cellular phone 
numbers.

Addresses where no phone number was found were contacted by CAPI 
interviewers. Addresses where a phone number was found were contacted by 
phone in order to recruit a respondent. These phone numbers were contacted
up to 16 times at different times during the day and week. The person whose
birthday was most recent in household were selected. Substitution within 
the household was not permitted. 

When the right respondent was met, the interviewer shortly explained the 
purpose of the survey and tried to arrange a personal interview. 
Respondents who did not wish to participate were instead offered to 
complete the survey via postal or web questionnaire. Respondents who did 
not complete the questionnaire within the given time frame were given two
reminders. Respondents opting for the postal questionnaires were given a 
reminder after the deadline and 14 days later. Respondents opting for the 
web questionnaire were given a reminder four days after receiving the 
questionnaire and eight after the deadline. As the recruiting was an on-
going process questionnaires and reminders were sent on an on-going basis.

The overall response rate is about 41.6%. About 10% of these completed 
interviews are verified by a second phone call, to control the authenticity
in terms of respondents age and gender. 

(3) The Danish data of 2007 include a sample weight to control for the
representativeness of the population under study, taking age, gender, 
education and the electoral results into account.

Researchers should care about the fact that the originally deposited Danish
data included a second subsample, based on a web-panel. The web-panel
was selected by probability methods and is being considered for inclusion
in the upcoming final release of CSES Module 3, but it does not yet appear.

However, the sample weight coded in C1010_1 depends on the complete Danish
sample, existing of the subsample described before, as well as of the 
excluded web-panel. Consequently, the employed weight in C1010_1 might 
slightly be biased.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - ESTONIA (2011)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) The March 2011 elections were the first to be held following the global
economic crisis that began in 2008. In 2011, the Prime Minister's coalition
government was challenged by the Centre Party, the SDE, the Estonian Greens
and the Estonian People's Union.

The country was severely hit by the global economic crisis, with gross
domestic product (GDP) shrinking by 14 per cent in 2009. The country's
economy showed signs of recovery in 2010. 

The leading parties focused on taxation. The two parties in the outgoing
government pledged to maintain a single rate for value-added tax 
(VAT), income tax and corporate tax. The opposition parties promised to
introduce a progressive taxation system, reducing the VAT on food. The SDE
promised to levy a 26 per-cent income tax on persons earning more than
1,000 Euros per month while maintaining it at 21 per cent for persons 
earning less. The SDE also promised to triple the child allowance for all
under-19s and guarantee each child a place in nursery, in addition to
providing free education. The Centre Party  argued that the VAT increase
and budget cuts had weakened the economy and affected the financial
situation of many Estonians. 

The parties in the outgoing government increased their presence, together 
securing a majority in the newly elected parliament. Prime Minister Ansip's
Reform Party won 33 seats, up from 31; and the IRL took 23 seats, up from 
19. The SDE also increased its seats to 19, up from 10, while the Centre 
Party fell from 29 to 26 seats. The Estonian People's Union and the 
Estonian Greens failed to surpass the 5 per-cent threshold required to win
parliamentary representation.

(2) The Estonian sample was a stratified random sample. In the first stage, 
sampling points were chosen in 15 counties, determined by the countys 
share of the total eligible population according to information from the 
Population Register of the Ministry of Interior. The interviews were 
conducted by using the random route method. On average five interviews were
achieved per sampling point. A household in every third house or apartment
was chosen and the last birthday rule was used to pick a respondent from
the household. Three visits were made before replacing a household with
another in case the respondent was not available. Substituting within the
household was not allowed.

In sum, 2513 households were sampled, out of which 1453 households had
been eligible for interviewing. According to the 1000 completed 
questionnaires, the Estonian response rate for 2011 was about 68.8%.

All interviews were held between March, 7th and April, 18th 2011, as
face-to-face interviews. On average, the interviewers were 52 years 
old, with an average interviewer experience of 4.5 years. All of them had 
secondary education (about 50%) or higher. Roughly 79% of interviewers 
conducted interviews in Estonian and 21% in Russian. The interviewers were
trained individually by the Saar Poll company, an Estonian social and 
market research centre. In addition, interviewers received written 
instructions. About 10% of the completed interviews were verified 
through mail, by a shortened questionnaire.

(3) Data on Estonia 2011 include a socio-demographic weight (C1010_2) to
make the sample representative of the population being studied. The 
constructed weight is based on data from the Population Register of the 
Ministry of Interior, processed by AS Andmevara. It combines the overall
distributions of gender, ethnicity, region, and rural-urban nature of 
settlement.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - FINLAND (2007)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) The March 2007 elections came on the heels of the country's presidency
of the European Union from July to December 2006. As a result, the election 
campaign started late compared to previous ones. In the 2007 elections, 
1,205 men and 799 women were vying for the 200 seats in the parliament. 

As in previous elections, employment and taxation were the main issues in 
the 2007 elections. Prime Minister Vanhanen pledged to reduce VAT on food. 
The SDP said the VAT reduction must apply to ordinary goods so as to help 
people with the most modest and average incomes. The KOK pledged to cut the
income tax of people with small and medium incomes.  

The biggest winner in the 2007 elections was the KOK, which gained ten more
seats, winning 50 in all. Former KOK leader Sauli Niinistö was re-elected
with over 60,000 votes or 10 per cent of the party's votes nationwide. The
KESK remained the largest party in the parliament by winning 51 seats,
although it lost four. The SDP lost eight seats, winning 45, reportedly 
suffering from the low turnout. The SDP lost its position as the country's
second largest party for the first time since 1962.

(2) The CSES module was implemented in a face-to-face post-election survey 
between March 20, 2007 and May 20, 2007. The questionnaire was translated
into Finnish and Swedish. The sample was meant to be representative of 
Finnish citizens aged 18 or over living in Finland (excluding the Åland 
Islands, which accounts for 0.48% of the population). There was a 
different sampling procedure for Finnish-speaking Finns and 
Swedish-speaking Finns. For the former, a quota sample was used based on 
gender, age, and province. The interviews were conducted by using the 
random walk method, in which the interviewers made five subsequent 
interviews proceeding from a randomly selected starting point. In cities,
the interviewers were given specific starting addresses, whereas in rural
areas they were allowed to select the starting points by themselves.
For the Swedish-speaking Finns a quota sample was used based on gender,
age, and electoral district, which includes only the districts with a 
significant population of Swedish-speaking Finns, i.e. Helsinki, Uusimaa,
Varsinais-Suomi, and Vaasa. Furthermore, in the selected districts, only 
the municipalities with a significant population of Swedish-speaking Finns
were included in the study. The quotas for the interviews of Swedish-
speaking Finns were formed by ordering an especially large random sample 
from the population register. The sample consisted of enfranchised Swedish-
speaking people in the selected municipalities, and it was ten times larger
than the desired number of respondents.

The original sample contained 1422 respondents which included an oversample
(209 cases) of the Swedish-speaking Finns. In the final dataset, the number
of cases is 1283, of which 5.5 % (71 cases) are Swedish-speaking Finns. 
The oversample was corrected by randomly dropping out 138 Swedish-speaking
Finns. Average response rate was 24.25 % of all the contacted households,
which includes households where no one was reached, households where no one 
belonged to the target group, and the households where none of the 
respondents matched the available control quotas.

Note that the electoral district Åland was excluded from sampling.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Following amendments to the Electoral Act, which came into force in 
2010, the 2011 elections were held in April instead of March.

As a result of the global economic crisis, the country's gross domestic 
product (GDP) shrunk by 8.1 per cent in 2009 but grew by 3.1 per cent in 
2010. In June 2010, Mr. Vanhanen stepped down as KESK leader and Prime 
Minister following funding scandals in his party. Ms. Mari Kiviniemi took
over both  posts, becoming the first woman Prime Minister of Finland. She
led the same four-party coalition government until the 2011 elections. 

On 16 February 2011, the outgoing legislature voted to approve several 
constitutional amendments, with 144 votes in favour and 29 against. In 
order to take effect, however, they needed to be approved by the new 
legislature, to be elected in April. One of the amendments specifically 
states that Finland is a member of the European Union (EU). Another 
stipulates that any disagreement between the country's President and the 
Government must be resolved by the Parliament. 

Parliament was dissolved on 15 March in view of elections in which 2,315 
candidates, including 903 women, were running. 

Major election issues at the beginning of the campaign included taxation 
and compulsory teaching of Swedish. The debates on taxation and the Swedish
language were pushed to the backburner after 6 April, when Portugal
officially requested a financial bailout from the EU. Finland's financial
contribution to the EU became the focus of the election campaign. Parties
in the outgoing government said they would support the bailout for 
Portugal. Opposition parties were more reluctant. 

The KOK came in first with 44 seats, followed by the SDP with 42. The True 
Finns more than quadrupled its share to 39. Prime Minister Kiviniemi's KESK
came in fourth with 35 seats. The Left Alliance and the Green League took 
14 and 10 seats respectively. The Swedish People's Party and the KD took 
nine and six seats respectively.

(2) The CSES module was implemented in a face-to-face post-election survey
between April 18 and May 28, 2011. The questionnaire was translated
into Finnish and Swedish. The sample was meant to be representative of
Finnish citizens aged 18 or over living in Finland (excluding the Åland
Islands, which accounts for 0.49% of the population). 
There was a different sampling procedure for Finnish-speaking Finns and
Swedish-speaking Finns. For the former, a quota sample was used, based on
gender, age, and the regional distribution of the target population. The
interviews were conducted by using the random walk method, in which the
interviewers made five subsequent interviews proceeding from a randomly
selected starting point. 

For the Swedish-speaking Finns a quota sample was used, based on electoral
districts with a significant population of Swedish-speaking Finns, i.e. 
Helsinki, Uusimaa, Finaldn Propoer, and Vaasa. Furthermore, in the selected
districts, only the municipalities with a significant population of 
Swedish-speaking Finns were included in the study, based on information
Finlandssvenskarna 2009 Report, compiled by The Swedish Assembly of 
Finland (Folktinget). In the first stage, a random sample of 1800 Swedish-
speaking persons was drawn from the Finnish Population Register Centre. In
the second stage, quotas were formed, based on the age, gender and 
constituency-specific distribution in the random sample.

The final sample contained 1298 respondents, including 1223 Finnish-
speaking and 75 Swedish-speaking Finns. The average response rate was 
24.25% of all the contacted households, including households where no
one was reached, households where no one belonged to the target group, and
households where none of the respondents matched the available control
quotas.

(3) The Finnish data include a political weight. It controls for the 
electoral outcome of the parliament election in 2011, based on respondents 
vote choice in C3023_LH_PL.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - FRANCE (2007)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) The 2007 elections to the National Assembly followed the election as 
President of the Republic of Mr. Nicolas Sarkozy, of the Union for a 
Popular Movement (UMP, the ruling centre-right party). In May, Mr. Sarkozy
defeated Ms. Ségolène Royal of the main opposition Socialist Party (PS) in 
a run-off election, and pledged to take the country into a new era, both 
economically and socially. The UMP held 359 seats in the outgoing 
legislature, while the PS had 149. The June parliamentary elections saw 
once again a duel between the UMP and the PS. President Sarkozy insisted 
that he needed a majority in the National Assembly to carry out his 
presidential programme. Pre-election polls predicted a major victory for 
the UMP. In all, 7,639 candidates contested 577 seats in the National 
Assembly. 

On 10 June, 60.42 per cent of registered voters turned out at the first 
round of the polls, the lowest figure since 1958. 110 candidates were 
elected in the first round, compared to 58 in the 2002 elections. The UMP 
and its allies took 98 of those 110 seats, securing 39.54 per cent of the 
valid votes while the PS obtained 24.73 per cent of the votes. Twelve women
were elected. 

Fiscal issues took centre stage during the period between the first and 
second rounds. Prime Minister François Fillon came in for scathing 
criticism from the PS over the government's supposed plans to introduce a 
"social VAT" (value-added tax). 

On 17 June, the second round of elections for the remaining 467 seats 
involved candidates who had obtained over 12.5 per cent of the registered 
vote in the first round. Nearly 60 per cent of registered voters turned out
at the polls. The UMP fared less well than opinion polls had predicted. The
Energy and Environment Minister and former prime minister, Alain Juppé 
(UMP) was narrowly defeated and subsequently resigned as minister. The 
final results nevertheless confirmed a clear victory for the UMP, giving it
a total of 313 of the 577 seats. The PS took 186 seats.

(2) The CSES module was implemented between June 18 2007, and July 7 2007 
September 13, 2005 and December 20, 2005, after the elections in telephone 
interviews. The sample consists of 2000 persons aged 18-96 years. The 
sample is selected from the mational metropolitan population over 18, 
registered on electoral lists; overseas territories were excluded from 
target population. Institutionalized people and military personnel were 
included in the sampling frame. Official statistics register 87.6% of 
households as having a phone (only land line phones), which excludes some 
15% of households from the sampling frame. Furthermore unlisted numbers 
were not included, which represents some 16% of households with a land line
phone. It was decided not to include unlisted numbers so that sampling 
frames make it possible to locate precisely households (so that their 
precise vote is recorded). The sampling procedure consists of a stratified
three stage probability sampling. Stratification: Table with 7 ZEAT areas 
and 6 agglomeration classes, i.e. 42 cells. Each cell contains the 
corresponding population size. Stage 1: Allocation of 200 Primary Sampling 
Units (districts)) to the defined cells using Cox Method of controlled 
rounding. Selection of PSUs from the cells according to the allocation 
proportional to population size. Stage 2: Selection of a fixed number (10)
of households from the selected PSUs via a random draw in phone book. 
Stage 3: Selection of an individual within a household via Last-Birthday-
Method. The primary sampling units (PSU) were districts (circonscriptions) 
so that each PSU has an homogenous political offer, selected by the Cox 
Method of controlled rounding (randomly selected). Each unit has been 
randomly drawn through adapted techniques, without clustering, 
substitution, or quota sampling at any stage. Participants did not receive
incentives for their participation. The telephone interviewers (mainly 
student and young educated adults from 20 to 30 -25.4 on average), had, on 
average one year of experience. Interviewer training was conducted in a 
half a day with thorough explanation of sampling strategy and method and 
overview of the questionnaire. Interviewers received special training in 
refusal conversion and reissue of refusals to and other interviewer.

The average contact per household for the entire sample was 8.2 over 15 
days. The response rate was 34.2%. The total number of household in the 
sample was 10469, out of which, 5849 valid households, for a total of 2000 
completed interviews. Weights are necessary to make the sample 
representative for two reasons: a) unequal probabilities of selection, 
especially due to random draw in households of unequal size, and b) a 
posteriori observation of bias on a number of selected variables.

(3) Weights: The French data of origin includes for weights:

C1010_1 (design weight) refers to an unequal probabilities of selection and
is defined as the product of the probability of selection of i-th 
observation in its PSU and the corresponding probability of selecting this 
observation in its household.

C1010_2 corrects for a selections bias bases on gender, age, education, 
occupation and household size. All these variables have been considered in 
their French definition, which do not match international classifications. 
Existence of bias after weighting depends on these various definitions of 
categories.

C1010_3 is due to control for political skewness, computed to correct for a
bias on aggregate electoral results of legislative elections.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - GERMANY (2005)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Following his Social Democratic Party's heavy defeat in local 
elections in May 2005, Chancellor Gerhard Schröder orchestrated a negative 
vote of confidence in parliament on 1 July to pave the way for new 
parliamentary elections. He insisted he needed a fresh mandate in order to 
continue his reforms to revive the German economy. On 21 July 2005, 
President Horst Köhler announced the dissolution of the Bundestag and 
called early elections for 18 September 2005, one year ahead of schedule. 

The election campaign focused both on domestic and foreign policy issues. 
Mr. Schröder came to power in 1998 promising to lower the unemployment 
rate. His recent reforms, known as Hartz IV, which aimed to reduce 
unemployment and welfare benefits in order to make the labour market more 
flexible, had reportedly produced little impact and frustrated both the 
unemployed and employers. His rival, Ms. Merkel, argued that a faster pace 
of reform was necessary. Her programmes included a two per cent VAT 
increase to finance a reduction in social security costs for employers. The
two leaders also held contrasting views over Turkish accession to the 
European Union (EU). While Chancellor Schröder insisted that Turkish 
membership would ensure long-term security in Europe, Ms. Merkel firmly 
opposed Turkey joining the EU and proposed a "privileged partnership" 
instead. 

Two major turning points in the campaign seem to have been the 
televised debate between the two leaders on 4 September and Ms. Merkel's 
appointment of Mr. Paul Kirchof as economic adviser. Mr. Kirchof, known as 
a radical thinker, advocated a simplification of the tax system and, in 
particular, a flat 25 per-cent income tax for all, which reportedly split 
the CDU supporters. His proposals were also criticized by the CSU. 

Official results, excluding Dresden, showed that neither the CDU nor the 
SPD had secured enough seats to easily form a ruling coalition. The CDU/CSU 
coalition won 225 seats, followed closely by the SPD with 222 seats. Voting
in the 160th district in Dresden was held separately on 2 October 
due to the death of a candidate. The CDU won the seat, bringing the 
total seats for the CDU/CSU coalition to 226.

(2) The German data for CSES Module 3 was realized by telephone interviews, 
focusing on the Bundestag elections of September 18, 2005. The interviews 
were conducted by telephone, starting on September 21. The new Laender 
(East Germany) were over-sampled. The survey includes 1014 respondents
from East Germany and 1004 from West Germany. The sample can be analyzed 
either separately for East and West, or, if appropriately weighted, for 
Germany, as a whole. Interviewing period was completed at November 05, 2005 

The sample is a single-stage random household sample. An initial sample was
drawn from the Infratest Telephone Household Master Sample (ITMS), which 
comprises a multi-stratified, largely unclustered sample that is 
distributed in proportion to the number of private households in micro-
cells, thereby compensating for regional or local differences in the 
telephone density of households. The estimated percentage of households 
without a telephone for the whole of Germany is about one percent.
Institutionalized persons (about four percent) are not included in the 
sample. The existing sample frame covers all listed and unlisted numbers in
Germany. To be interviewed, respondents must be at least 18 years old and 
German citizens. Finally, households were designated non-sample after 12 
unsuccessful callbacks. On average, the interviewer were 27 years old, with
22 month of corresponding experience. Interviewers were trained in two 
seasons, according to the questionnaire and the type of questions, as well
as to dialoguing and argumentation. The response rate of completed 
interviews was 65.6%.

(3) Due to the over-sampling of East Germany, as explained before, the use
of weights is necessary to study the German sample as a whole (weight 
provided). Furthermore a weight is needed to compensate differences in the
distributions of relevant socio-demographic variables in the sample due to
periodical population shifts. According to the federal structure of 
Germany, this weight, based on age groups and sex, corrects for the 
population within each region. Users, employing the original weights 
should take care about the fact that the weight to control the oversampling
of East Germany also controls for the skewness of socio-demographics with 
each of the federal states. Consequently, a combination of both weights is
not necessary.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - GERMANY (2009)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) The 2009 parliamentary elections were held against the backdrop of the
global economic crisis, which severely affected the country's automobile 
industry. In September 2008, the government announced a rescue package 
involving 4.5 billion Euros in loans and credit guarantees. 

The CDU and the SPD disagreed on many issues. In the 2009 elections, 
Chancellor Merkel's CDU sought to win more seats so as to form a new 
coalition government with the Free Democratic Party (FDP). The FDP, led by
Mr. Guido Westerwelle, is known for its pro-business policies based on the
free market economy. In July 2009, the CSU, led by Mr. Horst Seehofer, 
opposed the country's ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, aimed at improving
the decision-making process of the European Union (EU). The CDU announced
that it intended to maintain its partnership with the CSU after the 2009
elections. The CDU/CSU was challenged by Mr. Franz Müntefering's SPD. 

The major parties focused on the economy and nuclear energy in the 2009 
election campaign. Chancellor Merkel argued that a CDU/CSU-FDP coalition
was the only way to guarantee economic stability in Germany. The CDU 
pledged to revive the country's economy by creating more jobs and
combating unemployment. It also promised tax cuts and greater investment
in education. The FDP promised to reduce the State's involvement in
economic policy and opposed the introduction of a minimum wage proposed
by the SPD. 

The 2009 elections resulted in the creation of a record 24 overhang seats,
up from 16 in the 2005 elections, bringing the total number of seats in the
new legislature to 622. The final results gave 194 seats to the CDU, 14 
more than it had in the 2005 elections. The CSU took 45 seats. The 
CDU/CSU's future coalition partner, the FDP, won 93, up from 61, giving Ms.
Merkel's camp a total of 332 seats. In its worst showing since the end of 
World War II, the SPD lost 76 seats, dropping to 146. Its rival, the Left 
Party, won 76 seats, 22 more than in the outgoing legislature. The Green 
Party took 68, 17 more than in 2005.

(2) The German data for CSES Module 3 was conducted as face to face 
interviews, focusing on the Bundestag elections of September 27, 2009. The
interviews were held face to face, for a period running from September 29th
to November 23rd, 2009. The new Laender (East Germany) were over-sampled. 
The survey includes 1569 respondents from West and 526 respondents from 
West Germany. The sample can be analyzed either separately for East and 
West, or, if appropriately weighted, for Germany, as a whole, explained 
in section 3), below.

The sample was applied on the ADM-Design. The ADM-Design is a three-step 
random-design of face to face area sampling, which includes the whole 
populated area of Germany. It is based on a municipality -structure, which
is lodged with data of communal statistics, and with the regional divisions
prepared for the navigation systems. On the base of this data 53,000 areas 
are electronically defined, which include on average 700 private 
households. The Sampling Points and the Households to be interviewed have 
already been extracted, using the Adress-Random-Methode, for the Pre-
Election Study Component of the German Longitudinal Election Study (GLES)
of the GESIS. The institute extracted by chance twelve households out of 
the remaining addresses and transmitted them to the interviewer. The 
interviewer had to contact all the twelve addresses and should absolve at 
least six interviews within these addresses. The probability of 
interviewing in the post-election study was independent of the pre-election
one. Households were designated as non-sample if they were defined as non-
residential sample point, including vacant housing units, if all members of
the household were ineligible to vote, including language problems, and if
the household was reached after at least five contacts.

To be interviewed, respondents must be at least 16 years old and German 
citizens. Institutionalized persons (about four percent of the eligible 
population) were excluded of the sample frame. However, interviews of 
respondents younger than 18 years had been deleted afterwards. The response
rate of completed interviews was 51.4%, based on the number of valid 
households.

(3) Due to the over-sampling of East Germany, as explained before, the use
of weights is necessary to study the German sample as a whole (weight 
provided). Furthermore a weight is needed to compensate differences in the
distributions of relevant socio-demographic variables in the sample due to
periodical population shifts. According to the federal structure of 
Germany, this weight, based on age groups and sex, corrects for the 
population within each region. Users, employing the original weights should
note that the weight to control the oversampling of East Germany also
controls for the skewness of socio-demographics with each of the 
federal states. Consequently, a combination of both weights is not 
necessary.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - GREECE (2009)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) On 3 September 2009, Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis asked President
Karolos Papoulias to dissolve Parliament with a view to holding early 
elections, arguing that he needed a new mandate to help steer the country 
out of the economic crisis. On 7 September, President Papoulias dissolved 
Parliament and called elections for 4 October, nearly two years before they
were constitutionally due. 

The 2009 elections were held against the backdrop of the global economic 
crisis. The unemployment rate reached 8.5 per cent in May 2009. The 
government provided 28 billion euros in bailout packages to banks and 
privatized several public-sector companies in a bid to boost investment and
create jobs. The country's public debt was expected to exceed 100 per cent 
of GDP in 2009. The budget deficit was expected to rise to 6.2 per cent of
GDP in 2009 and 7.3 per cent in 2010. The European Union (EU) had set 2010 
as the deadline for Greece to reduce its budget deficit.  

The 2009 elections once again saw a duel between the ND and the PASOK. 
Both the ND and the PASOK underscored the need to tackle the economic 
crisis, albeit with different approaches.  The two parties also differed on
immigration policy. 

The final results gave a resounding victory to the PASOK, which took 160 
seats. The ND followed with 91 seats, losing 61. Mr. Karamanlis announced 
that he would step down as the leader of the ND.

(2) The Greek survey was realized as a post-election study by telephone 
interviews. To become part of the sample, respondents had to have the Greek
citizenship, as well as the right to vote in national parliamentary 
elections. Finally, the sample was restricted to respondents aged 18 to 89
years, excluding politicians, political office persons and candidates. 

The sampling process based on a random selection of geographical areas,
built on the total population possessing a phone, stratified by Attica, 
Thessaloniki and the rest of Greece. Sample was based on the national 
telephone database, whereas about 17% of the Greek population was 
excluded due to not having a telephone. Within the geographical units quota
sampling was used, to control for the overall distribution of sex and age,
according to the Greek Census data of 2001.
For further information on the sampling process, as well as on the overall
distribution of age and sex in the Greek society, we advise users to have a
look at the Greek Design Report, available at the CSES-website.

The interviewers were between 22 and 43 years old, with an average 
interview experience of about 3 years, referring to social and political
surveys. About 80% of the interviewers were university students. The 
interviewers' course of instruction included 12 hours of training for 
beginners, a two hour briefing for experienced, as well as a written manual
for all interviewers.

The interviews took place between December 10th and December 19th, 2009. 
Each of the sampled households was contacted only once. In sum, out of the
7,812 households 1,022 interviews were successfully completed. About one 
third of these interviews have been verified due to quality control 
purposes.


(3) There is no demographic weight variable for this election study. Given
that the Greek sample was based on quotas (see former section), weights are
not necessary to make the population under study representative .

Instead, a political weight is included in C1010_3 to control for political
skewness, computed to correct for a bias on aggregate electoral results of
the Greek legislative election of 2009.

(1) Election summary not available.. 
For the information about the conduct of the election see: 
http://www.eac.gov.hk/en/legco/2008lce_report1.htm.

(2) The CSES questionnaire was implemented as a single telephone study. The
sample population was defined as registered voters, depending on 
permanently citizens of Hong Kong, aged 18 or older. In contrast, an 
estimated amount of about one percent of the sample population was excluded
due to not having a telephone. The same is true for military persons, who 
are Chinese soldiers and hence no registered voters of Hong Kong. 
The sampling process was a two stage random sample, based on the Hong Kong 
Telephone Directory. In a first stage, the last two digits of each phone 
number were replaced at haphazard. In a second stage, individual 
respondents were randomly selected from all eligible voters within a given
household.

On average, each of the sampled households had been contacted 1.96 times. 
The maximal number of contacts had been five, at different days and day 
times, before a household was defined as non-sample. Moreover, households,
which refused in the first contact, were called a second time at a 
different day.

In total, the sample included 17,504 first stage units, out of which 16,154
were at least of an unknown validity. From the remaining 1,350 households 
another 535 units disappeared due to non-contact, refusals or break-offs 
and partial interviews. All in all, 815 interviews were successfully 
completed, referring to a responds rate of 60.4%, based on the amount of 
valid telephone numbers.

Interviews were held by undergraduate students of the Lingnan University,
who had received basic training in surveying and interviewing. Furthermore,
the interviewers were trained according to basic skills of survey 
interviews and in how to conduct telephone surveys. Finally all of them had
accumulated experiences by participating in other telephone interviews 
prior to the CSES study.


(3) A sample weight is included to correct for skweness in the distribution
age, sex, and the region of residence, according to the sampling process. 
As a benchmark, the "Age and Sex profile of registered electors by 
Legislative Council Constituencies in 2010" has been used, available at 
the website of the Hong Kong Registration and Electoral Office.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - ICELAND (2007)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) The 12 May 2007 elections took place amid a heated debate on whether
the country should prioritize economic growth or the environment, 
crystallized by a proposal to build new dams and aluminum smelters. 

The IP has dominated Icelandic politics since the country gained 
independence from Denmark in 1944. Since 1995, it has led a coalition 
government with the Progressive Party (PP). The PP pledged to continue 
corporate tax cuts in order to maintain a favorable environment for 
Icelandic business. The main opposition parties promised to stop the
smelters project until appropriate studies on their environmental impact
were carried out. 

The final results gave 25 seats to the IP. However, the PP took only 
seven (down from 12 seats in the 2003 elections), giving a majority of just 
one seat to the outgoing coalition. The Social Democratic Alliance 
won 18, losing two; while the Left-Green Alliance gained an extra four 
seats, winning nine in total. The Liberal Party kept its four seats, while
the Icelandic Movement did not win any seats.

On 17 May, Prime Minister Haarde and the PP leader Mr. Sigurdsson, 
announced that they would discontinue their coalition following the PP's 
poor election results.

(2) The sample is meant to be representative of all voters in Iceland. 
Eligible voters are citizens from 18 years onwards. Institutionalized 
persons were excluded from the sample frame. In 2007 they were around 
0.02 % of persons with a permanent residency in Iceland (60 / 307.672).
The information about the number of prisoners that were Icelandic citizens
comes from the Institute for Icelandic Prisons (i.icelandic; 
Fangelsismálastofnun Íslands). 

The total number, 307,672 is from Statistics Iceland and includes all 
Icelandic citizens and foreign citizens that had residency in Iceland 
on January 1, 2007.
The simple random sample was drawn from the National registry, and 
the primary sampling unit was the individual. SPSS was used to draw a 
random sample from the population. 7.7% of the total eligible population 
were excluded from the sample. These are persons who had requested that 
their name would not be included in any sample drawn from the National 
registry according to information from Statistics Iceland.
Interviews were conducted by telephone. It is estimated that less than 
1% of the populations does not own a phone or mobile phone. According to
the Post and Telecom Administration in Iceland around 96% have a landline.

(3) The data set includes a weight variable (C1010_2) for age, as e.g. 
proportionally fewer in the younger age groups replied to the survey 
compared to the distribution of age in the population according to 
information from Statistics Iceland. 

The weight variable was calculated by dividing the proportion of each 
age according in the population with the proportion of age in the sample. 
An example for the sample of 18 years old respondents: The total number 
of persons in the population at the age of 18 to 80 were 219,875 on 
January 1, 2007. Of them 4,714 were 18 years old (year of birth=1999), 
or 2.1% of the total. In the sample, 1,8% were 18 years old (year of birth
=1999, N=1.595). The weight for 18 years old is therefore 2.1/1.8=1.22

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - ICELAND (2009)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) The April 2009 elections were held against the backdrop of the global
financial crisis, which brought down the Government in January 2009. 
They were constitutionally due by May 2011. 

The financial crisis that erupted in the United States in 2008 severely 
damaged Iceland's economy. In October 2008, the country's three main banks
collapsed within the space of a week. The national debt soared to ten 
times the gross domestic product. Despite emergency aid of nearly US$ 
1.4 billion under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout plan a
nd an additional loan of US$ 2.5 billion from its Nordic neighbours 
(Finland, Norway, Denmark and Sweden), the country's currency, the Krona,
continued to plummet and unemployment and inflation spiralled. The Prime
Minister tried in vain to save the situation by proposing early elections
in May but ultimately announced that he would step down on 26 January. 

The main contenders were the SDA, the LGM, the IP, the PP and the Liberal
Party (which took four seats in 2004). Two new parties formed after the 
financial crisis - the Civic Movement (CM) and the Democracy Movement (DC)
- were also vying for seats. Although the SDA and the LGM said they would
form a new coalition government, they disagreed on a key issue, the 
country's accession to the European Union (EU). The other parties were 
also divided over EU membership. 

The SDA came in first with 20 seats; its coalition partner, the LGM, took
14. The IP and the PP took 16 and nine seats respectively. The CM won four
while the LP and the DC failed to win parliamentary representation. 
The elections also resulted in a high turnover of members, with 27
candidates being elected to parliament for the first time.

(2) The sample is meant to be representative of all voters in Iceland. 
Eligible voters are citizens from 18 years onwards. Institutionalized 
persons were excluded from the sample frame. In 2009 they were around 
0,003 % of persons with a permanent residency in Iceland (80 / 319.368). 
The information about the number of prisoners that were Icelandic citizens
comes from the Institute for Icelandic Prisons (i.icelandic; 
Fangelsismálastofnun Íslands). 

The total number, 319,368 is from Statistics Iceland and includes all 
Icelandic citizens and foreign citizens that had residency in Iceland 
January 1, 2009.
The simple random sample was drawn from the National registry, and
the primary sampling unit was individuals. Excel was used to draw a 
random sample from the population. Interviews were conducted by telephone.
It is estimated that less than 1% of the populations does not own a phone
or mobile phone according to the Post and Telecom Administration  96% 
have access to a landline. 

Approximately 25.2% of the total eligible population were excluded from 
the sample. These were 7.5% (24,024 / 307,672) persons who had requested
that their name would not be included in any sample drawn from the 
National registry according to information from Statistics Iceland. 
Another around 17.7/ (N=2,600; sample) were excluded because their phone 
numbers were not listed. Only some unlisted numbers were looked up using 
home address and surnames of respondents.

(3) The data set includes a weight variable (C1010_2) for age, as e.g. 
proportionally fewer in the younger age groups replied to the survey 
compared to the distribution of age in the population according to
information from Statistics Iceland. 

The weight variable was calculated by dividing the proportion of each
age according in the population with the proportion of age in the sample.
The total number of person in the population on the age from 18 to 80 were
229,659, January 1, 2009. Of them 4,943 were 18 years old 
(year of birth=2001), or 2.2% of the total. In the sample, 0.5% were 
18 (year of birth=1999, N=1,385). The weight for 18 years old is therefore
2.2/0.5=4.26

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - IRELAND (2007)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) On 29 April 2007, Prime Minister Bertie Ahern asked the country's
President, Mary McAleese, to dissolve the parliament, paving the way for 
elections to the House of Representatives on 24 May. A total of 466
candidates ran for the 2007 elections, in which Mr. Ahern sought a third
term in office. 

The country enjoyed strong economic growth under the coalition government. 
Mr. Ahern, who had played a major role in political reconciliation in 
Northern Ireland, helped broker another power-sharing agreement in early 
May 2007. He pledged tax cuts, free health screening, and higher pensions.
However, he suffered a setback when news leaked that he had received money
from a friend to renovate a house in Dublin, which he subsequently bought.

Fianna Fáil's partner, the Progressive Democrats, was led by Justice 
Minister Michael McDowell. During the election campaign, Mr. McDowell was
faced a scandal involving the country's most secure prison, from which a 
convicted armed robber had phoned a call-in TV show using a mobile phone.
Further investigation revealed the presence of illegal drugs and smuggled 
mobile phones within the prison, which raised public concern. 

Fine Gael, led by Mr. Enda Kenny, and the Labour Party of Mr. Pat Rabbitte,
formed a centre-left alliance. Both parties criticized the government for 
failing to improve public services. Fine Gael presented a platform 
entitled, promising improved health services, more resources for tackling 
crime, better childcare services, and fairer taxes. 

The coalition government remained the largest group in the House of 
Representatives by winning a total of 80 seats (78 went to Fianna Fáil 
and two to the Progressive Democrats), but failed to win an absolute 
majority. The opposition Fine Gael gained 20 more seats, winning 51, 
with the Labour Party taking 20 seats. The Greens took six seats, while
Sinn Fein took four. The five remaining seats went to independent 
candidates. The new House of Representatives had 41 first-time MPs. 

(Source: PARLINE database: http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/parline.htm) 

(2) For the 2007 survey, 2135 respondents who had responded in 2002 were 
selected (excluding only those who had died or who had moved in the 
intervening years and no follow-up address was available). Interviews were
obtained from 1013 people. A short mail questionnaire was sent to 
non-respondents and this succeeded in getting 130 replies. 43 percent of 
interviews were completed by the end of June, a month after the election,
with 88 percent completed by the end of July and 95 percent by the end of
August.

In addition, a supplementary three-stage sample was selected from the 
Geo-Directory (a national listing of all addresses). At the first stage, 
addresses were clustered by electoral division, with EDs aggregated to 
give a minimum population of 1,000 addresses. One cluster was selected at
random within each of 39 Constituencies. At the second stage, addresses 
were selected at random from each cluster (total of 630 addresses). At the 
third stage, a respondent was selected within the household so as to 
over-represent adults who would not be included in the follow-up sample. 

The rule was as follows:

If the household contains one or more person age 18-23 who is registered 
to vote, use the next birthday rule to select the respondent from this 
group. If the household contains no adult age 18 to 23, select the 
respondent with the next birthday from this group (must be eligible to 
vote in national election).

If the household contains one or more person age 18-23 who is registered 
to vote, use the next birthday rule to select the respondent from this 
group. If the household contains no adult age 18 to 23, select the 
respondent with the next birthday from this group (must be eligible to 
vote in national election). From there 283 interviews were obtained. 
Nine responses to the mail questionnaire were received from other than 
the target respondents and these are also included.

The PSUs were Electoral Divisions (ED)or aggregates of electoral divisions.
EDs were aggregated so that each PSU had a minimum size of 1,000 electors
(2002) or 1,000 addresses (2007). PSUs were selected using a systematic 
sample, having sorted by area and characteristics of area (socio-economic 
status, urban-rural location), with a random start. The sort means that an 
element of stratification is incorporated. 

(3) There are two sets of weight variables for 2007, one looking back to 
the 2002 sample and a second providing a representative cross section in 
2007. For the follow-up (panel) sample, the weight from 2002 was carried 
forward to the 2007 sample. The resulting sample was then calibrated to 
population totals from 2002 using a minimum distance algorithm (Gross, 
developed by Johanna Gomulka).

For the 2007 cross-sectional sample, a design weight was first applied
(based on number of adults age 18 and over in the household) to the 
supplementary sample, the 2002 weight was carried forward for the panel
sample, and the weighted (by design weight/2002 weight) sample totals were
calibrated to the population totals using the Gross minimum distance 
algorithm. These population totals are from the 2006 Census and the 
Quarterly National Household Survey in terms of household size (number of
adults age 18 and over), age, sex, education, economic status, marital 
status and region.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - ISRAEL (2006)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Parliamentary elections, originally scheduled for November 2006, were 
held on 28 March 2006, four months after the collapse of Prime Minister 
Ariel Sharon's government on 20 November 2005. The government had been in
difficulty since Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip began in August 
2005, which caused rifts within Mr. Sharon's Likud Party. On 9 November
2005, Amir Peretz became leader of the Labour Party, and took Labour out of 
the coalition government. Mr. Sharon, who had helped found the centre-right 
Likud Party in 1973, subsequently established a new party called Kadima 
("Forward" in Hebrew). Mr. Sharon said Kadima would seek to end the 
long-time domination of Israeli politics by Likud and Labour. He announced 
that his party would support the creation of a Palestinian State, while at
the same time maintaining all of Jerusalem under Israeli control. A number 
of leading figures on the left and right, including former Labour leader 
and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Mr. Shimon Peres, and Likud Defence Minister
Shaul Mofaz, joined the new party. 

Mr. Sharon suffered a major stroke in mid-December 2005, which left him 
incapacitated and unable to continue his political duties. Nevertheless, 
his legacy continued to cast a shadow over the election campaign. Kadima 
was led into the elections by interim Prime Minister Mr. Ehud Olmert. Mr. 
Peretz emphasized Labour's social platform, while Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu, 
who had been elected as Likud's new leader in December 2005, insisted that 
additional unilateral territorial pullbacks would merely increase Israel's
vulnerability to terrorist attacks. Many observers viewed the elections as
a referendum on future policy in the occupied territories of the West Bank. 

The final results gave Kadima 29 seats, followed by the Labour Party with 
19 seats. Other possible coalition partners for Kadima won a total of 30 
seats: the Sephardi ultra-orthodox Shas party obtained 12, followed by the 
Gil (Pensioners Party) with a surprising seven seats; the ultra-orthodox 
Torah Judaism and the left-wing Meretz respectively won six and five seats. 
On the right, Likud came in first with 12 seats, followed by the far-right 
parties Yisrael Beitenu and the National Union - National Religious Party 
(Ichud Leumi- Mafdal: NRP) which won respectively 11 and nine seats. The 
remaining ten seats went to three predominantly Arab parties: Hadash, 
National Democratic Alliance (Balad) and United Arab List (Ra'am).

(2) The CSES module was implemented between June 17 and July 28, 2006,
after the March 18 election through telephonic interviews. The sample 
consists of 1200 persons aged 18 years or older who are citizens of Israel. 
The primary sampling unit is the household, randomly selected. Telephone
listings were employed to determine the random selection of households (not
through random digit dial (RDD), but listed). Final selection was made 
according to which person answered the phone and corresponded to the above
criteria. The final sample consists of a stratified sample of Jews, Arabs
and former Soviet Union immigrants by geographical areas, and random
sampling in each of the strata. The sample excludes some parts of the 
population, for instance Arabs who live in east Jerusalem; because they 
are not citizens of Israel, (East Jerusalem Arabs are about 3% of the 
Israeli population). Military persons while at home were included, but not
those who were in military camps at the time of the study. 
Institutionalized individuals were also excluded from the sample 
since there is no telephone in such institutions. All other households 
without access to a telephone, or are not listed in the telephone 
directory, were excluded by default: households without telephones 
represent about 13% of total households. A quota sampling method was used 
for the group of immigrants from the former USSR. However, no substitution 
of individuals permitted at any stage of the selection process or during 
fieldwork. Response rate was 10.02%, from 11977 valid households (13780 
total), 1200 interviews were completed (6950 refused or broke-off, while 
3827 were not successfully contacted).

(3) There is no weight variable for this election study given that weights
are not necessary to make the population under study representative of 
the general population of Israel.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - JAPAN (2007)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) General elections were held on 29 July for half of the 242-member 
House of Councillors, the Upper Chamber of the Japanese Diet. A total of 
377 candidates (218 for the prefectural constituencies, and 159 
under the party list) contested the 2007 elections.

Incumbent Prime Minister Shinzo Abe promised to build a "beautiful country" 
and pledged to resolve the issue of individuals believed to have been 
abducted by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the 1970s and 
1980s. Former Peruvian President, Alberto Fujimori, who was under house 
arrest in Chile, filed his candidature under the proportional 
representation list of the People's New Party.

Changes in the electoral law reduced the number of seats in the LDP 
stronghold in rural areas and attributed more seats to big cities like 
Tokyo. Both parties targeted the 29 constituencies where only one seat was 
being renewed. 

During the election campaign, a major earthquake hit the northern part of 
Japan on 16 July. 

The ruling LDP suffered a heavy defeat, taking only 37 seats, The total 
number of LDP seats was reduced to 83 in the 242-member House of 
Councillors, which meant that the LDP lost control of the chamber for the 
first time since the party's inception in 1955. The LDP's coalition 
partner, the New Komeito, took nine seats. Inversely, the opposition DPJ 
won a record 60 seats and became the largest party in the House of 
Councillors. Other seats went to small parties and independent candidates. 
The former Peruvian President, Mr. Fujimori, was not elected.

(2) The post election study for CSES module 3 of Japan was carried out
between July 31, 2007 and August 13, 2007 as face-to-face-interviews. The 
original sample was part of a panel study, the Asian Barometer, referring 
to all Japanese voters aged 20 years or older, who are Japanese citizens
and registered as voters. The sample was filled up with additional 
addresses to enlarge the total sample size. This additional sample part was
processed in a two-step manner: The primary sampling units had been the
electoral districts, sampled with probability-proportional-to-size (PPS)
selection. From each district, about 8-14 samples (based on the population
in each district) were selected with an equal probability sampling
mechanism (EPSEM). In the second step, individual respondents were
randomly selected, based on the voting registry. The selected persons
were informed by letter before the first interviewer contact.
The interviewers themselves were mostly been females (84%) aged 50
years or older (70% irrespectively of the gender). 45% of the
interviewers had experience of more than ten years and were continuously
trained. Finally, an incentive of 1000 Yen (about US$9) was paid
to respondents for any successfully completed interview. 

(3) As the implementation of the CSES Module 3 notes, Japan used two 
different samples for CSES module 3. Consequently weights are necessary to 
make the sample representative of the population being studied and to 
compensate bias and potential skewness in relevant demographic factors. The 
included weights in the original data file were constructed by strata of 
six layers of age (20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, and over 70) and gender, based 
on the frequencies of Population Census of Japan 2005.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - LATVIA (2010)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) The 2010 elections were the first to be held following the 2008 global
economic crisis that severely hit the country. In December 2008 Latvia was
granted a 7.5-billion-euro bailout from by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and another 1.3 billion euros from the European Union (EU). The
country's economy shrank by 18 per cent in 2009 and unemployment soared
to 20 per cent. Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis who took office in 
March 2009 implemented austerity measures including wage cuts of up to 50
per cent in the public sector. 

The 2010 elections were contested by 1 234 candidates from 13 political
parties and coalitions of political parties. They saw a duel between the
centre-right Unity coalition led by Prime Minister Dombrovskis and the
left-wing opposition Centre for Harmony (SC) led by the Mayor of the
capital Riga Mr. Nils Usakovs. 

Prime Minister Dombrovskis called on voters' support for the Unity
coalition arguing that the austerity measures implemented under his
government were the only way to restore the country's economy. The SC
pledged to provide a social-democratic alternative and criticized
the government for its budget cuts and tax increases. It pledged to
renegotiate the reimbursement plan of the bailout granted by the IMF and
the EU and withdraw Latvian troops from Afghanistan. 

Five parties/coalitions surpassed the 5-per cent threshold. The Unity
coalition came in first with 33 seats winning four more seats than its
rival SC. Prime Minister Dombrovskis received the highest number of
preferential votes. The other parties in his outgoing government - the ZZS 
and the National Alliance - took 22 and eight seats respectively. For a
Better Latvia (LPP-LC) won eight seats while the PCTVL failed to win
parliamentary representation.

(2) The study is a post-election study for the 2010 legislative election.
The sample is meant to be representative of Citizens of the Republic of
Latvia, age 18-74.
It was proceeded in four stages: 1) selection of sampling points,
2) selection of addresses; 3) selection of households; 4) selection of
a respondent. Primary sampling units are sampling points which were
selected from the complete list of Latvias populated points, with the
number of citizens as a size measure. Populated points are sorted by
region, district and urbanization level to keep regional and urban
proportions in the sample. The planned number of sample points is
calculated with the assumption of 10 interviews in each sample point.
The random number determines the point in the list of cities or parishes,
from which the selection must begin with and beginning from this point,
considering certain steps, cities or parishes, to be included in the
sample, are selected. The random starting address for an interviewers
route is selected within each sampling point; the selection within urban
areas is based on lists of dwellings (addresses).
Households are selected according to the route instructions, each second
dwelling in apartment buildings, each second home in an area of individual
houses; ascending or descending sequence varies on odd and even sizes of
streets.
Within the second sampling stage - selection of addresses - starting
address for an interviewers route in each sampling point is chosen
randomly. During the third sampling stage -  selection of households -
every second dwelling in apartment buildings, every second home in an area
of individual houses; ascending or descending sequence varies on odd and
even sizes of streets is chosen. But the last sampling stage - selection
of respondent - includes "the principle of the youngest man in the
household".

(3)To make the survey data representative to the universe, the data
weighting in this survey was performed with an aim to get the sample
division as close as possible to the universe. Criteria that was used for
the data weighting are:  age, nationality, region, type of residence and
gender.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - MEXICO (2006)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Mexicans went to the polls on 2 July 2006 to elect all members of the 
Chamber of Deputies and the Senate as well as a new President. The main 
issues in the 2006 elections were the high crime rate, poverty and 
undocumented Mexican workers in the United States. The PAN endorsed Mr. 
Felipe Calderon as its presidential candidate and presented tough policies
on crime, including life sentences for kidnappers. The PRD, led by the 
former Mayor of Mexico City, Mr. Manuel Lopez Obrador, formed an alliance,
called the "Alliance for the Good of All", with the Labor Party and the 
Convergence Party (CONV). The alliance fought the elections under the 
slogan "For the Good of All, the poor first", pledging to improve 
healthcare and education. The Alliance for Mexico coalition was composed of
the PRI and the Green Party of Mexico (PVEM). The PRI, led by former 
senator Mr. Roberto Madrazo, pledged to create nine million jobs inside 
Mexico to prevent Mexican workers migrating to the United States. Other 
main parties in the 2006 elections were the New Alliance Party (NA), formed
by former PRI member Mr. Roberto Campa, and the Social Democratic and 
Peasant Alternative Party (ALT), led by the prominent civil and women 
rights activist, Ms. Patricia Mercado. 

The final results for parliamentary elections gave a resounding victory to 
the ruling PAN in both chambers, winning 206 seats in the Chamber of 
Deputies, up from 158; and 52 seats in the Senate. The Alliance for
the Good of All won respectively 158 and 36 seats. The Alliance for Mexico
took 123 and 39 seats. In the presidential election, a narrow margin 
separated the leading candidates. After a partial recount, Mr. Calderon was
declared elected on 6 July with 35.88 per cent of the valid votes, just
0.6 percentage points ahead of Mr. Lopez Obrador. On 8 July, 100,000 people
responded to Mr. Obrador's call to protest the election results. He filed a
legal challenge to the results on 10 July, alleging widespread fraud and 
calling for a manual recount of every ballot. On 6 September, the Federal 
Electoral Tribunal confirmed the victory of Mr. Calderon.

(2) This is a face-to-face, post-election study focused on the Mexican
presidential and legislative elections of 2006. The sample was selected 
through a multistage procedure in which the universe was stratified in 
four regions according to geography and partisanship of the state governor.
An independent sample was drawn within each region. Within each region, the
primary sampling units were electoral precincts clusters. The clusters were
defined as groups of all of the precincts with similar vote for PRI and 
belonging to the same county (municipality). In the second stage the 
precincts within the clusters were selected with probability proportional 
to size (PPS). The third stage had been blocks randomly selected in the
precinct area In each block, houses are selected following systematic 
methods of random start households within the precinct and the 
last stage was the respondent in the selected household. Respondents in the
household were not selected randomly. Interviewers followed quotas of 
gender and age. The response rate was calculated to be 46.5%.


(3) Weights are estimated and used to correct for unequal probability on 
the selection of sampling units. Additionally, post stratification weights 
were estimated to correct for non-response and to match known demographic 
characteristics of the population gender and age.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - MEXICO (2009)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) At stake in the July 2009 elections were 500 seats in the Chamber of 
Deputies. 

In the 2009 elections, the PAN was once again challenged by the PRI. The 
latter had dominated the country's presidency from 1929 until the election
of Mr. Vicente Fox (PAN) in 2000. PRI's new leader, Ms. Beatriz Elena 
Paredes Rangel, emphasized that the party had learned from its errors, 
referring to past corruption problems. The PRI used a slogan "proven 
experience, new attitude", recalling over seven decades of the party's 
leadership. It pledged to provide new economic policies to tackle the 
economic crisis. President Calderon pledged to continue to tackle crime. 
According to the  government, crime-related deaths dropped by 26 per cent
in the first trimester of 2009. He urged voters' to allow the PAN to 
continue to work for economic growth, job creation and public safety. 
The PRD led by Mr. Jesús Ortega also vowed to tackle organized crime. 
However, it was reportedly losing ground due to internal splits. 

Polling took place without major incidents in most areas, except in the
state of Guerrero where 11 people, including a PRD town councilor and 
his family, were killed. 

The PRI won a decisive victory securing 237 seats, up from 104. The PAN
came in second with 143 seats, losing 63. The PRD took 71 seats, losing
55. Of all the eight parties represented in the outgoing Chamber, only 
the Social Democratic and Peasant Alternative Party (ALT) failed to win 
seats.

(2) This is a face-to-face, post-election study focused on the Mexican
legislative elections of 2009 and is representative of the national 
population 18 years or older. The sample was selected by a multistage 
procedure in which the universe was stratified in three dominions: states
with elections for governor, states with local legislatures and states 
without concurrent elections. An independent sample was drawn within each 
region. In each dominion four layers of similar electoral competition were 
formed. In the first stage electoral sections were selected with 
probability proportional to size of the nominal listing (PPS). In the 
second stage blocks of houses were selected following systematic methods of
random start, and in a third stage houses within the blocks were chosen 
also following systematic methods of random start. In the households, 
respondents are selected according to more recent birthday. Response rate
was 58.9%.

(3) The Mexican data includes two different weights. A first sampling 
weight corrects for unequal probability of selection sampling units. A
second post-stratification weight is available to correct for non-response
and to match known demographic characteristics of the populations (gender
and age).

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - NETHERLANDS (2006) 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Early elections were held for all seats in the House of Representatives
on 22 November 2006. 

The main electoral issues included economic reforms and immigration 
policies. Mr. Balkenende called on voters to support the strong economic 
recovery under his government and criticized the PvdA's plans to tax 
pensioners. The PvdA argued that the government was asking too much from 
citizens with low and medium income and not enough from the country's 
richest citizens. The SP leader Mr. Jan Marijnissen said he would put an 
end to excessive economic liberalism. 

Mr. Balkenende also pledged to continue his tough immigration policies 
insisting that illegal immigrants should be deported. The Immigration 
Minister Ms. Rita Verdonk (VVD) said that if reelected the government would 
ban the wearing of full-length veils (burqas) in public. The PvdA leader 
Mr. Wouter Bos insisted on the importance of the country's tradition of 
multi-culturalism and tolerance. The left-wing opposition argued in favour 
of a general pardon for an estimated 26000 asylum seekers whose 
applications had been previously turned down. 

Neither the right nor the left won a clear majority. The Prime Minister's 
centre-right CDA remained the largest party with 41 seats. The VVD won 22 
the Party for Freedom took nine and the D66 three. The main left-wing 
opposition the PvdA remained the second largest party with 33 seats. The 
SP won 25 seats 16 more than in 2003 thus becoming the fourth largest 
party. The Green Left won seven seats while the centre-left Christian Union 
took six.

(2) The Dutch 2006 CSES study was included in The Dutch Parliamentary 
Election Study 2006 (DPES). The DPES 2006 consists of several parts: the 
first wave of interviews, the second wave of interviews, a self-completion 
questionnaire, a non-response project and a stimulus project. The first 
wave of interviews was held during the six weeks before the elections on 
November 22, 2006. The second wave of interviews was held shortly after the 
elections. The self-completion questionnaire was left with the respondents 
of the second wave, to fill in for themselves. A number of non-respondents 
of the first and second wave were approached with a telephone or written 
questionnaire. 

The second wave of interviews, containing the CSES questionnaire, was 
conducted between November 23, 2006 and January 4, 2007. The goal was to 
interview most people at the beginning of this period. In this second wave 
2359 respondents of the first wave were re-interviewed. They were again 
visited at their homes and interviews were conducted with an electronic 
questionnaire (CAPI) with questions that were different from the first 
wave. Note that most of demographic variables have been added to the 
data-file by Statistics Netherlands on the basis of population records
(i.e., they were not part of the administered questionnaire. 

The study is based on a two-stage sampling procedure. In the first stage 
the primary units are selected and for every selected unit the number of 
secondary units to be selected is set. In the DPES 2006 the primary units 
were municipalities. Persons are the secondary unit. 
Within every municipality an equal preset number of persons is selected. 
After that the municipalities are selected with unequal chances in 
proportion to the number of persons in the municipalities in question. The 
largest municipalities, including Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and 
Utrecht, are automatically included in the sample. Persons in these 
municipalities are selected with an equal chance as the rest of the sample. 
This way a self weighing sample comes about, with a preset sample size. In 
the DPES the number of persons to be selected in every municipality was 12. 

In order to achieve a high response rate, respondents were carefully 
contacted. First, the respondents received a letter of introduction. 
Enclosed with this letter was a small set of stamps. Every respondent was 
visited at least once during the first half of the observation period of 
three weeks (see above). A card was left behind if the first three house 
calls were unsuccessful and the respondent was not present. After that, the 
interviewer tried to contact the intended respondent by phone in order to 
make an appointment for an interview. Meanwhile the interviewer kept 
visiting the address. An address could only be labeled as a definite 'no 
contact after six idle visits. 

When the response was achieved in the first wave, an appointment was made 
for a second wave interview. These appointments were planned as shortly as 
possible after the election date, so the responses of the second wave were 
concentrated at the beginning of the fieldwork period. It was also 
preferred that the interviewer of the second wave was the same person as 
the one that conducted the first interview. 

Respondents of the second wave interviews were asked to fill in a self- 
completion questionnaire. Persons that had not send in their questionnaire 
after a week received a letter of reminder with a new questionnaire and a 
reply envelope. 

Response rate in the pre-election wave was 66.9%. In the post-election 
wave, 89.9% of 1st wave participants took par, which makes 60.2% of the 
initial first-wave sample.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - NETHERLANDS (2010) 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

(1) Early elections were held for all seats in the House of Representatives 
on June 9, 2010. The elections followed the collapse of Prime Minister Jan 
Peter Balkenende's fourth coalition government (comprising the CDA the PvdA
the Christian Union and the Democrats 66) in February 2010.

Disagreement over continuing the Dutch military involvement in Afghanistan
was the immediate cause of the collapse of the coalition. Prime Minister's
CDA was in favour extending the deployment of Dutch troupes beyond 2010, 
but the PvdA was vehemently opposed. 

Shortly before the 2010 elections the country's Bureau for Economic Policy 
Analysis announced that 29 billion euros would have to be cut from public 
spending by 2015 prompting many parties to focus on the budget cuts during
the election campaign. The parties on the left and the right presented 
conflicting austerity plans.

The pre-election debate also focused on immigration. The VVD promised a 
reduction in benefits for immigrants while the PVV pledged to restrict 
immigration. The PvdA was reportedly drawing support from immigrants thanks
to its new leader Mr.Job Cohen who had been popular among the immigrant 
community while serving as Amsterdam Mayor.

As in the 2006 elections no party secured a majority in 2010. The final 
results gave 31 seats to the VVD and 30 to the PvdA. The PVV came in third
with 24 seats while the CDA took 21 seats. After lengthy negotiations on 29
September the CDA and the VVD agreed to form a coalition government with 
parliamentary support from the PVV.

(2) Dutch 2010 CSES study was conducted as part of The Dutch Parliamentary 
Election Study 2010 (DPES). The DPES 2010 consists of several parts: two 
waves of face-to-face interviews - before and after the elections, and a 
drop-off questionnaire distributed after the post-election wave.

The first wave of interviews was was administered in May 2010. The post-
election wave of interviews started on June 10, and ended on July 22, 2010.
The CSES questions were predominantly, but not exclusively, asked in the 
second wave.

The Dutch Electorate of the 2010 elections, as represented in the electoral
registers, represented the sampling frame. The frame excluded 
institutionalized persons (about 1.5%), and two geographic regions. The 
Wadden isles in the North Sea have been excluded because of logistic 
problems. And some postal codes in South-Eastern Amsterdam have been 
excluded because these areas are not considered to be safe at every time of
the day. This is less than 0,01% of the population. In total less than 3,5 
percent from the eligible population was excluded.

Respondents (individuals, not households) were selected on the basis of 
official population records. Selection was done in a two-step procedure. 
The first step selects primary sampling units (municipalities). Based on a 
set minimum number of successful interviews of 12, a desired net post-
election sample size of at least 1,800, and an estimated response rate of 
55 percent, municipalities were drawn with a weight proportional to the 
number of enfranchised voters. In the second step, a constant number of 
persons to be approached was drawn from the electoral registers in the 
selected municipalities. The product of these two steps ensured that the 
inclusion probability was the same for all enfranchised voters.
In order to achieve a high response rate, some received a set of the most
commonly used stamps, value 4.00 Eurpos, others a gift certificate. Maximum
number of contact attempts made per respondent (person) was 6.

The most conservative estimate of the response levels is 62,4 percent 
(first wave), and 53,8% for the first and second wave. A more positive 
view on response in the first wave (excluding errors in the sampling frame 
and including all CAPI, CATI and PAPI and aborted interviews) is 65,9%.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) On 12 September, Prime Minister Helen Clark announced that the House
of Representatives would be dissolved on 3 October and that elections would
be held on 8 November. 

The 2008 elections once again saw a duel between the Labour Party and the 
National Party. Prior to the elections, scandals involving the Foreign 
Minister and the economic slowdown reportedly gave the opposition National
Party the lead in opinion polls. 

In late September, the national statistics office announced that the 
country's economy had fallen into recession for the first time since 1998.
The global financial crisis reportedly worsened the situation in the 
run-up to the elections. 

Prime Minister Clark of the Labour Party promised a deposit guarantee 
scheme to protect investments, expanded training opportunities for youth,
and a universal student allowance by abolishing parental income testing. 
National Party leader John Key pledged to protect businesses from 
financial losses. His party's policies included income tax cuts and
more spending on key infrastructure projects such as roads, schools
and a broadband network. It promised to promptly execute dam projects on
the West Coast, opposed by the Labour government. 

The final results gave 58 seats to the National Party and 43 to the 
Labour Party. The Greens won nine seats, followed by the ACT and the 
Maori Party, which took five seats each. The Progressive Party and the 
United Future won one seat each. New Zealand First failed to win any 
parliamentary representation. 

(Source: PARLINE database: http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/parline.htm)

(2) The study is meant to be representative of New Zealanders on the 
electoral roll immediately prior to the 2008 election. A very small number 
who registered in the two weeks before the election were 
excluded. The sample is a random sample from the electronic electoral 
rolls. (A panel component was also present, but all data submitted to the 
CSES is from those freshly sampled for the 2008 election.)
Sampling units were selected using SPSS select cases (random sample).
Furthermore, the sample was partitioned into four groups. 
New Zealanders of Maori descent can choose to be registered on a 
separate Maori roll, and cast their electorate votes within seven 
constituencies that overlie the general electorates. For its new sample
the 2008 New Zealand Election Study randomly sampled within four subsets
of registered voters and oversampled subsets 1, 3, and 4 below, groups of
particular interest to the researchers. 

1. Those on Maori roll 27 and over
2. Those on General roll 27 and over
3. Those on Maori roll 18-26
4. Those on General Roll 18-26

For the CSES release, respondents from the three oversampled subsets were
re-sampled to bring their numbers into the appropriate proportions among
registered voters, removing any need for sampling weights.
Those sampled were given the opportunity to fill out the questionnaire 
online but could only do so with the appropriate password and identifier.

Without reducing the full sample totals by any means (deceased, 
inaccessible, or anything else) percentages of respondents out of the 
totals originally sampled were:

General roll, 27 and over: 42.8%
General roll, 18-26: 22.0%
Maori roll, 27 and over: 27.3%
Maori roll, 18-26: 12.7%

Effective response rates would be somewhat higher if deceased and 
inaccessibles were removed from the denominator, but the New Zealand 
electoral roll is well maintained and therefore quite up to date.

Population data for age and sex comes from the electronic version of the 
rolls used for sampling. Age groups are reported in five-year bands.
The target sex ratio was estimated from a separate sample of 10,000 from 
the roll data. This data is only available under conditions of 
confidentiality for purposes of social science research from the Electoral
Enrolment Centre. Education data comes from the 2006 census, available 
online at the Statistics New Zealand website.

The large discrepancies reflect to some extent the propensity of 
respondents to be concentrated among the more educated. However, 
highest qualification data available from the New Zealand latest census
in 2006 does not tie in particularly well to the codes requested by the 
CSES or those most respondents would recognize in a survey. The New 
Zealand qualifications framework has changed significantly over the last 
thirty years, making older respondents responses difficult to reconcile
with current codes. I simply dont believe that 45% of people over 15 in 
New Zealand in 2008 had no education or had not completed primary school
- what this data apparently signifies, (New Zealands minimum school 
leaving age was set at 15 in 1944, with most children leaving primary 
school at age 12). Accumulating from lower qualifications upward, the 
percentage without post-secondary qualifications in the 2006 census data
is 63 per cent: in the weighted sample it is 55 per cent. However, the 
most obvious discrepancy is the proportion of university-educated, twice 
what it should be. An alternative weight is available to adjust for this,
along with sex and age, although not included in this version of the CSES 
deposit.

(3) The weights were designed to match known sex and age distributions in 
the electoral roll from which the sample was taken.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - NORWAY (2005)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Norwegians went to the polls on 12 September 2005 to elect an enlarged 
parliament of 169 members, up from 165. Since the 2001 elections, when the
Labour Party had suffered its worst result in 90 years, the country had
been led by a center-right minority coalition under Prime Minister Kjell
Magne Bondevik, which controlled 62 of 165 seats in parliament
(Stortinget). The coalition was composed of three parties: the Prime
Minister's Christian People's Party, the Conservatives and the Liberal
Party. The coalition also had support from the far right Progress Party,
known for its anti-immigration policy, which had won 26 seats in the 2001
elections, bringing the number of seats controlled by government to 88. The
three main opposition parties formed the Red-Green alliance composed of
former Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg's Labour Party, the Socialist Left
Party and the Centre Party (Agrarians), holding 76 seats in all. One MP
represented the Coastal Party, defending the interests of fishing
communities and opposing membership of the European Union. 77.4 per cent of
Norway's 3.4 million eligible voters cast their ballots on election day.

Final results gave an absolute majority of 87 seats to the Red-Green 
alliance, while the outgoing government and its ally, the Progress Party, 
won a total of 82 seats. Within the winning coalition, the Labour Party 
increased its seats to 61, up from 43 in the 2001 elections. The Centre 
Party (Agrarians) obtained 11 seats, one more than the previous election, 
while the Socialist Left Party was reduced to 15 seats, having lost eight. 
The Conservative Party, the biggest party in the outgoing government, 
suffered its worst results in its history, retaining 23 seats and losing 
15. The Christian People's Party won 11 seats, down from 22. On the other 
hand, the Liberal Party won its largest number of seats ever: ten, up from 
two. The far-right Progress Party, led by Mr. Carl Hagen, increased its 
seats from 26 to 38, becoming the second largest party in the new 
parliament. The Coastal Party lost its only seat.

(2) The CSES module was implemented in a face-to-face post-election survey 
between September 13, 2005 and December 20, 2005. The original sample 
consists of 3000 persons aged 18-79 years which is part of an rolling panel 
(half of the sample replaced at each election). The sample is selected from 
registers covering all Norwegian inhabitants, and in accordance with 
Statistics Norway's sampling frame. Local municipalities are employed as 
primary sampling units (PSUS). In Norway there are 435 municipalities in 19 
counties, but municipalities with very few inhabitants were pooled with 
adjacent municipalities to form one PSU. A total of 363 PSUS were then 
stratified into 109 strata. Stratification variables were industrial 
structure, number of inhabitants, centrality, communication structures, 
commuting patterns, trade areas and (local) media coverage. Stratification 
was done such that no PSU had less than 7 per cent of the total population 
in its stratum, and separately for each county. All PSUS with more than 
30000 inhabitants, and some with a population number between 25000 and 
30000, constitute separate strata. For the remaining PSUS, the most
possible homogeneous strata was formed. In a second stage one PSU was
selected from each stratum. PSUS which constituted separate strata were
included with certainty. For the remaining strata, one unit was drawn with
probability proportional to the number of inhabitants. A sample of survey
units (persons) was drawn from the population register, selected from the
109 sampling areas, using systematic random sampling. The sampling fraction
at the second stage is proportional with the inverse selection probability
at the first stage. The final sample then is self-weighting when both
stages are taken into consideration. If a sampled unit from the panel
sample has moved out of their original psu, it is still included in the
sample. Response rate was 68%. The total amount of households in the
sample was 2965, out of which 2012 interviews were completed (655 refused
or broke-off, 142 were not successfully contacted, 156 other non-response).

(3) No weights are necessary to make the sample representative of the 
population, hence weights are not included in the data file.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - NORWAY (2009):
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) The September 2009 elections were the first to be held after 
constitutional amendments in February 2007 effectively transformed the 
Parliament (Stortinget) into a purely unicameral parliament as of 1 October
2009. Until now, the Stortinget, although unicameral, used to split into 
two bodies (the Odelsting and the Lagting) when handling legislation. These
two bodies were abolished after the 2009 elections. 

The 2009 elections were held against the backdrop of the global economic 
crisis which had also hit Norway. The main issue in the 2009 elections was
how much oil revenue should be used for public expenditure. Prime Minister
Stoltenberg's Labour Party, known for its pro-oil industry stance, 
initially argued that the Arctic and Lofoten coastlines should be opened
for oil drilling in addition to the current North Sea reserves, but
then withdrew its proposals due to opposition from the Socialist Left 
Party. The Progress Party argued that more of the oil fund should be used 
for public works and taxes should be lowered.

The final results gave 86 seats to Prime Minister Stoltenberg's coalition,
including 64 to the Labour Party. It was the first time in 16 years that 
the governing coalition won the general elections. The Progressive Party 
remained the second largest party, winning 41 seats, followed by the 
Conservative Party with 30 seats.

 (2) The CSES module was implemented in a face-to-face post-election survey
between September 15, 2009 and February 04, 2010. The original sample 
consists of 2946 households, whereat half of the sample is part of an 
rolling panel of the previous election in 2005 (replaced at each election). 
For the interviewing, respondents had to be between 18 and 80 years old, as 
well as national citizens of Norway.

The sample was selected from registers covering all Norwegian inhabitants, 
and in accordance with Statistics Norway's sampling frame. 
Local municipalities are employed as primary sampling units (PSUS). In 
Norway there are 430 municipalities in 19 counties, but municipalities 
with very few inhabitants were pooled with adjacent municipalities to form 
one PSU. A total of 363 PSUS were then stratified into 109 strata.
Stratification variables were industrial structure, number of inhabitants, 
centrality, communication structures, commuting patterns, trade areas and 
(local) media coverage. Stratification was done such that no PSU had less 
than 7 per cent of the total population in its stratum, and separately for
each county. All PSUS with more than 30000 inhabitants, and some with a 
population number between 25000 and 30000, constitute separate strata. For
the remaining PSUS, the most possible homogeneous strata was formed. 
In a second stage one PSU was selected from each stratum. PSUS which 
constituted separate strata were included with certainty. For the remaining
strata, one unit was drawn with probability proportional to the number of 
inhabitants. A sample of survey units (persons) was drawn from the 
population register, selected from the 109 sampling areas, using systematic
random sampling. The sampling fraction at the second stage is proportional 
with the inverse selection probability at the first stage. 
The final sample then is self-weighting when both stages are taken into 
consideration. If a sampled unit from the panel sample has moved out of 
their original psu, it is still included in the sample. 

The total amount of households in the sample was 2946, out of which 1782 
interviews were completed (965 refused or broke-off, 197 were not 
successfully contacted, 2 other non-response). Response rate was 60.5%.


(3) No weights are necessary to make the sample representative of the 
population, hence weights are not included in the data file.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - PERU (2011):
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) The 2011 parliamentary elections were held in parallel with the
presidential polls and the elections for the country's representatives to
the Andean Parliament. At stake were 130 seats in the newly enlarged
Congress, up from 120. The media focused on the presidential race, pushing
the parliamentary polls to the back burner.

Mr. Humala's Peru Wins alliance pledged to review the Constitution on the
basis of a "new economic model". It promised to work for a greater State
role in the economy, and pledged to increase the tax on international 
mining companies and to prioritize natural gas produced at the Camisea 
fields for domestic use rather than for export. It also promised to 
provide free nursery and public education, and increase the minimum wage
and pensions.

Ms. Fujimori's Force 2011 Alliance promised to promote free trade and open
markets and reduce the costs of doing business by 20 per cent over the next
five years. It pledged to crack down on crime by applying harsher 
punishments, including the death penalty. It also promised to provide more
housing with water and basic sanitation. 

The Perú Posible Party, led by Mr. Toledo - Peru's first elected indigenous
president - focused on poverty reduction, promising to reduce the poverty
rate from the current 35 per cent to 10 per cent. It promised to transform
Peru into a maritime hub by improving logistics and infrastructure and
attracting more foreign investment to develop the country's economy.

Mr. Kuczynski's Alliance for Major Change pledged to eliminate extreme
poverty within 10 years and reduce sales tax from the current 18 to 15 per
cent. It promised to provide all Peruvians with clean drinking water. Mr.
Kuczynski pledged to surrender his US nationality if elected.

The final results gave 47 seats to the Peru Wins alliance and 38 to Force
2011 Alliance. Perú Posible Party came in third with 21 seats while the
Alliance for Major Change took 12 seats. The remainder went to small
parties. None of the presidential candidates secured an absolute majority. 
In the run-off presidential elections held on 5 June, Mr. Humala (Peru Wins
alliance) won over Ms. Fujimori (Force 2011 Alliance).

(2) This study was conducted as a post-election, face-to-face survey over
the period May 7th to May 08th, 2011. Multi-stage stratified sampling
was used, with the primary sampling units being housing blocks in cities
and towns in rural areas.

(3) The sample was weighted according to the number of population in 
each region and urban-rural distribution.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - PHILIPPINES (2010):
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) The May 2010 parliamentary elections were held concurrently with the 
presidential polls. At stake were 280 seats in the House of Representatives
(up from 269, see note) and half of the Senate seats (12). The media 
focused on the presidential polls, placing the parliamentary polls on the
back burner. 

The Lakas-Kampi-CMD coalition was challenged by the NP-NPC coalition. The 
NP leader, former Senate President Manny Villar, was also running for the
presidency. Mr. Villar, a property tycoon, focused on his rags-to-riches
story, but his image was reportedly tarnished by corruption allegations.
Former actor and president, Joseph Estrada, was also running. He had been
jailed in 2001 for corruption but was pardoned by President Arroyo later 
the same year. He reportedly remained popular thanks to his heroic gangster
movies. Senator Benigno Aquino III ran for the presidency on a Liberal Party 
(LP) ticket. The LP of former Speaker and Quezon City Mayor, Mr. Feliciano 
Belmonte Jr., was in coalition with the KKK (Kapayapaan, Katarungan, 
Kaunlaran). The LP coalition promised to lead a transparent administration.
Mr. Aquino vowed to open an investigation into past allegations of
corruption against President Arroyo.

As in the past, the elections were marred by violence, resulting in the 
death of over 90 people. Four municipalities in Mindanao declared that 
polling could not take place after poll workers reported harassment and 
death  threats. The election commission accepted the declaration and 
announced that it would organize special elections there. 

Technical problems with new automated voting machines that were being used
for the first time were reported in several polling stations. 

No major international organizations sent observer missions. The People's
International Observers' Mission 2010 (PIOM) noted several irregularities 
and criticized the lack of secrecy in certain precincts. 

The final results for the House of Representatives gave 119 seats to the 
LP, 45 to the Lakas-Kampi-CMD coalition, and 22 to the NP-NPC coalition. 
The remainder went to small parties. In the Senate, the LP and the NP-NPC 
coalition won three seats each. The Lakas-Kampi-CMD and the Pwersa ng 
Masang Pilipino (Force of the Filipino Masses) of outgoing Senate President
Juan Ponce Enrile took two seats each while the People's Reform Party (PRP)
took one seat. The remaining seat went to an independent candidate. In the
presidential elections, Mr. Aquino was elected with over 40 per cent of 
the votes.

(2) This post-election face-to-face survey was conducted between June 25 
and 28, 2010, in five languages: Filipino, Cebuano, Ilocano, Maranao, and 
Hiligaynon. For sampling purposes, the Philippines was divided into four
study areas: National Capital Region (NCR), Balance Luzon, Visayas, and
Mindanao. The sample size for each of the four study areas was 300
voting-age adults. Multi-stage probability sampling was used in the
selection of sample spots (60 spots per area). The three study areas, apart
from NCR, were further divided into regions, and then provinces were
selected from the regions according to the probability proportional to
population size (PPS) of the region. Once the sample provinces were
selected, 60 spots for each of the major areas were allocated among the
sample provinces. Using the quota set for each spot in each region, the
spots were distributed in such a way that each province was assigned a
number of spots roughly proportional to its population size. For the third
stage, within each sample spot, five to six households were established by
systematic sampling (random route procedure). The individual respondents
are identified using a probability selection table.

Overall, 2,994 households were selected, out of which 2,238 had been valid.
In sum, the Philippine sample includes 1,200 realized interviews, 300 in 
each of the study areas, resulting in a response rate of about 54%.

(3) According to the sample process, a sample weight is necessary, to 
control for disproportional sampling of the overall population size of the
study areas. The weight bases on data from the Philippine Census (2007), 
calculating the ratio the sample size of the an area and the projected 
population in the same area.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - POLAND (2005)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) On 25 September 2005, parliamentary elections were held for both 
chambers of the Polish Parliament: the 460-seat lower house (Sejm) and the
100-seat Senate (Senat), in parallel with presidential elections. .

The outgoing government had come to power promising to deal with 
unemployment, which had reached 16 per cent. Mr. Belka's policies included
tax cuts and an increase in social spending, but these reforms were
reportedly hampered by disagreements within his party. Long-running 
corruption scandals involving the SLD took the centre stage during the 
election campaign. 

The main rivals of the outgoing government were two centre-right parties, 
the Civic Platform (PO), led by Mr. Donald Tusk, a known free market 
advocate, and the more conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, led by Mr.
Jaroslaw Kaczynski. The two parties announced that they would seek to form a 
coalition government, although they proposed different tax policies during
the election campaign.

The final results showed major progress for the PiS and the PO, which won 
155 and 133 seats respectively in the Sejm, and 49 and 34 seats in the 
Senate. Self-Defense, a populist grouping advocating State-funded 
agriculture and an increase in government social programmes, came in third
in the Sejm with 56 seats. The SLD suffered a heavy defeat, retaining only
55 seats in the Sejm and none in the Senate. These elections marked the 
left's worst results since its establishment as reformed communists in 
1990. In the run-off presidential election held on 23 October, Mr. Lech 
Kaczynski beat Mr. Tusk by securing 54.04 per cent of the votes.

neither information about the implementation of the module in the Polish 
post election survey, nor about the sampling process had been available.

(3) The data include a demographic weight to make the sample comparable to 
the overall Polish population. Researchers note that the construction rules 
of the weight as well as the data used for the benchmark are unknown, to

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - POLAND (2007)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Following the collapse of the ruling coalition in August, parliamentary
elections were held on 21 October 2007, two years earlier than the official
due date. In all, 6,187 candidates, including 1,428 women, ran for the 
Sejm, while 385 candidates vied for seats in the Senate. 

The 2007 elections again saw a duel between the PiS, led by Mr. Jaroslaw 
Kaczynski, and the PO of Mr. Tusk. The PiS promised to continue its 
policies, focusing on the domestic economy and promising tax cuts. It 
appealed to voters to support it in the interest of steady economic 
growth. The PO pledged to introduce a flat income tax of 15 per cent and 
to continue the privatization of State companies that stagnated under the 
PiS-led government. It promised to forge better ties with neighbouring 
countries, and pledged to introduce the European single currency - the 
Euro - as soon as possible, to further economic development. Mr. Tusk 
also promised to work towards the withdrawal of Polish troops from Iraq. 

The Left Democratic Alliance (SLD), which had won 55 seats in the Sejm in 
the 2005 elections, formed an election coalition - LiD - with the Social 
Democracy of Poland (SDPL), the Democratic Party (PD), and the Labour 
Union (UP) in September 2006. The coalition was led by former president 
Mr. Aleksander Kwasniewski. He criticized the PiS-led government, arguing 
that the country could not afford a radical reduction of taxation. 

A total of 53.88 per cent of the country's 30 million registered voters 
turned out at the polls, representing the highest turnout in the post-
communist era. Due to the higher than expected turnout, some polling 
stations ran out of ballot papers, and others stayed open longer than 
scheduled, thus delaying the release of the first exit polls by nearly 
three hours. 

The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) observed 
the polls. Although it declared the elections to be pluralistic and 
democratic, it noted "sporadic partial interventions by State organs" in 
the election campaign. 

The final results gave the PO 209 seats in the Sejm and 60 seats in the 
Senate. The PiS took 166 and 39 seats respectively. The LiD and the 
Polish Peasant Party (PSL) took 53 and 31 seats in the Sejm, while the 
remaining one seat went to the German minority. One independent candidate 
was elected to the Senate. Outgoing Prime Minister, Mr. Jaroslaw 
Kaczynski, conceded defeat. 

(Source: PARLINE database: http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/parline.htm)

(2) The Polish interviews were held face-to-face as a post election survey.
Sampling was based on a four stage process, drawn accordingly to the 60 
territorial layers, defined on the basis of country region and size of the 
accommodation areas. Thereby the number of observations from each layer in 
the sample was proportional to the number of people from a given layer in
the population. In a first stage, district districts were chosen randomly. 
Second, within each of the selected districts, a sample of streets or 
resorts was drawn. In the third step, based on the map of streets or 
resorts, addresses of houses and apartments had been selected. Finally, 
within each of the chosen houses or apartments one person was randomly 
sampled. 


(3) The data include a demographic weight to make the sample comparable to 
the overall Polish population. Researcher should be aware of the fact that 
the construction rules of the weight as well as the used data for benchmark
are unknown, so far.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - PORTUGAL (2009)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) The September 2009 elections were held against the backdrop of the 
global economic crisis, which severely affected the country of 10 million 
inhabitants. How to deal with the economic crisis remained the main issue 
in the 2009 elections, in which 15 political parties were vying for seats. 

Prime Minister Socrates (PS) promised to implement large-scale public works 
projects to create more jobs. These included a new Lisbon airport, a bullet
train to Spain as well as a road and rail bridge across the River Tagus in
Lisbon. He also promised to continue economic and social reforms. 

The largest opposition party, the PPD/PSD, was led by Ms. Manuela Ferreira 
Leite, who was aspiring to become Portugal's first elected woman prime 
minister. Ms. Ferreira Leite argued that the PS's public works projects 
were wasteful and a non-essential luxury. She claimed that the PS would be
passing on debts to future generations. Ms. Ferreira Leite, a former 
finance minister, pledged to make huge cuts in government spending and 
boost private investment to revive the economy. 

The PS remained the largest party in the Assembly of the Republic with 97 
seats but failed to retain an absolute majority. The PPD/PSD took 81, six 
more than in the 2005 elections. The CDS-PP secured 21 seats, up from 12. 
The BE doubled its share from eight to 16. The PCP-PEV took the remaining 
15 seats.

(2) The sample was stratified by five regions (according to the C2027), as 
well as by the population size of localities (according to C2030). All in 
all, 113 areas were randomly selected, based on the corresponding 
definition of the National Statistics Office. The sample excludes the 
islands of Azores and Madeira, as well as institutionalized and military 
persons.

The further sampling process contains of three stages: First, the selection
of a starting point within each of the localities, using lists of ZIP codes
and tables of random numbers. Next, households had been sampled according 
to the given starting points, based on pre-determined instructions about 
the route to adopt and a systematic interval of households. Finally, within
each of the selected households, respondents had been chosen on the basis 
of next person having his/her birthday. 

To be interviewed people must have been at least 18 years old at the day of
contact and had to be registered as voters. In contrast, the Portuguese 
citizenship was no requirement for participating in the post election 
study. Selected Households were informed by letters. Incentives or 
payments had not been given to the respondents, whether before, nor after
the interviews.

The interviewers received advanced training for the interviews, procedures
of contact, and the method of random route. Interviews took place between 
October 2nd, 2009 and February 8th, 2010.

In total, 7151 households were selected, out of which 3532 had been invalid
addresses due to several reasons. From the residual 3619 household, 1317 
had been successfully contacted and interviewed, which corresponds to a
recourse of 36.39%. After removing 13 ineligible interviews, 1303 cases 
remained.

(3) The data include a demographic weight to make the sample comparable to 
the overall Portuguese population aged 18 years or older. The weight is 
based on the distribution of the target population in terms of gender, age, 
and education, according to the Portuguese National Statistics Office 
Census 2001. Thirteen respondents from the source file, who had system 
missing values in the weight variable, were removed from the CSES dataset, 
due to their ineligibility status.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - ROMANIA (2009):
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) The first round of Romanian presidential elections in 2009 took place 
at November 11th on schedule after a regular five-year term in office. For 
the first time in Romanian history, the presidential election was not held 
parallel to the one for the Romanian parliament, in order to "render the 
presidential elections less partisan and conflictual" (Muntean et al. 
2010: 754). Electoral campaigning formed three major candidates for the 
electoral race: The current president Traian Basescu (Democratic Liberal 
Party), his major challenger Mircea Geoana (Social Democratic Party), and 
Crin Antonescu (National Liberal Party). 

Since Basescu won the Romanian presidential election in 2004, his term in 
office was mainly determined by conflicts about the division of power 
between the parliament and the president and the presidential right of 
nominating the prime minister. These conflicts dominated the presidential 
electoral campaigns, polarizing the Romania electorate: "Basescus 
presentation of himself as acting for the people and against big interests,
specially those of the moguls and the former communists, was pitted 
against the oppositions view of him as a danger for democracy, a populist
ould-be dictator, who was incapable of collaborating with the parliament 
and the parties" (Muntean et al. 2010: 755). In addition, topics about 
changes in the Romanian flat tax system, the reduction of social security,
and private health care dominated the electoral campaigns. 

In the first round of the election, none of the favored candidates was
able to gain an absolute majority. Basescu and Geoana had to re-run for
the second round of elections, on December, 12th.|Traian Basescu managed 
to win an absolute majority (50.35) with a small advance over his 
challenger (49.7%). Thus, Basescu was re-elected as the Romanian president
for another five years. 

(Source: Muntean et al. 2010)

(2) Interviews in Romania took place between December 9th and 20th, 2009, 
as face-to-face interviews, after to the second round of presidential 
elections. The Romanian sample bases the third round of a three-wave panel,
which covers un-institutionalized Romanian citizens aged 18 years and 
older, registered as eligible voters. About 0.25% of the Romanian 
population was thus excluded due to being institutionalized.

The Romanian sampling process bases on two-step stratification. In the 
first stage voting districts (for parliament elections) were systematically
sampled, according to their proportionality of registered adults. The 
voting districts were stratified with regard to 18 cultural areas and seven
types of municipalities (poor communes, medium developed communes, 
developed communes, cities with less than 30,000 inhabitants, cities of 30-
100,000 inhabitants, cities of 100-200,000 inhabitants, cities with more
than 200,000 inhabitants). In sum, this first stage yields 126 strata, 
whereat strata with less than seven cases were added to the closest 
neighbor category, inside the same cultural area and the same type of 
residence (urban or rural). The resulting number of strata was of 96.In a 
second step, eight respondents were selected by systematic sampling with 
equal probabilities from the electoral register of each voting district 
(the main sample). A reserve sample of eight respondents was selected in 
order to compensate for refusals etc. This reserve sample was used to 
substitute incomplete interviews per primary sampling unit.

Romanian interviewers were mostly between 26 and 64 years old. About two 
thirds of them were females, mainly having a University undergraduate 
degree completed. Overall, 3157 households were sampled, out of which 2219
turned out to be valid. In the first round of the three-wave panel 1504 
persons were interviewed. The current Romanian sample, used for the CSES,
includes 1403 respondents. In sum, responds rate for the current sample is
about 68%.

(3) A demographic weight controls for differences in socio-demographic 
characteristics between the employed sample and the underlying Romanian 
population. The construction of the weight depends on the populations 
distribution of gender, age, education, and the region of residence, based
on data from the Romanian National Institute of Social and Economic 
Statistics (INS).

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - SLOVAKIA (2010)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) The June 2010 elections were the first to be held after the country's
adoption of the Euro in January 2009. They followed elections in Hungary 
(April) and the Czech Republic (May) in which centre-right parties regained
power after pledging to reduce their country's debt amid the Greek and euro
crises. In May, the Slovak Government agreed to make some 800 million Euros
available for the European Union's bailout package for Greece.

In 2010, 18 parties and 2,397 candidates were vying for seats in the
National Council. The parties in the outgoing government - the Smer-SD,
the LS-HZDS and the SNS - were challenged by the SDKU - DS and the KDH.
The SMK of Mr. Pal Csaky and the Most-Hid (Bridge) joined the parties on
the right. 

Prime Minister Fico called on voters to support his Smer-SD and its allies
so that he could continue to lead a "strong social State". The Smer-SD's
coalition partner, the SNS, focused on patriotism and traditional values.
statements. Although the SNS refrained from targeting the Hungarian 
minority during the election campaign, the party's election slogan 
was "Don't feed those who don't want to work". The SNS argued that 
the slogan referred to all those who abuse the welfare system. 

The LS-HZDS of Mr. Vladimir Meciar was reportedly weakened after certain 
prominent members, including Trnava regional governor Tibor Mikus, left the
party. 

The SDKU - DS, leading the parties on the right, pledged to reduce the 
budget deficit, improve the business environment to create more jobs, and 
tackle corruption. It opposed Slovakia's pledge to provide some 800 million
euros to Greece. 

The KDH and its leader, Mr. Jan Figel, focused on the party's traditional 
platform, underscoring the importance of Christian and family values. 

The SMK pledged to protect the interests of the country's 500,000 ethnic 
Hungarians in cooperation with the Hungarian Prime Minister, 

The Smer-SD increased its share to 62 seats. However, its ally, the SNS, 
took only nine seats, and the LS-HZDS failed to win parliamentary 
representation for the first time since its inception in 1991. The SDKU-DS
came in a distant second with 28 seats, followed by the SaS with 22 seats.
The KDH and the Most-Hid took 15 and 14 seats respectively. The SMK failed
to win parliamentary representation for the first time since its inception
in 1998. In all, 23 women were elected. Both Prime Minister Fico and the 
SDKU - DS election leader, Ms. Radicova, claimed election victory.

(2) The Slovakian post-election survey took place between June 18 and July 
20, 2010, as face-to-face interviews. Respondents had to be Slovakian 
citizens, aged 18 and older to become part of the sample, excluding 
institutionalized persons. Sample selection based on a stratified 
multistage probability sampling method: The first step of the selection 
process was due to defining 240 sampling units, according to the census of 
Slovak population by the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic. Second,
household addresses were sampled. Finally, respondents were chosen, 
employing the method of next birthday, taking restriction of the sample, 
e.g. age and nationality, into account. A selected respondent was due to 
non-sample after four unsuccessful contacts at various day times. Before 
the first personal contact, respondents received a letter about the 
interviewing. About 75 per cent of the interviewers were females, most of 
them of higher education. TNS SK trained all interviewers before as 
well as during the field work. 

(3) The Slovakian data include a demographic weight the make the sample
representative of the population under study. The weight compensates
for disproportional probability of selection, taking gender, age,
education, the size of settlement, and the region of residence into 
account.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) On 16 June 2008 President Danilo Türk signed a decree setting the date
of elections to the National Assembly for 21 September. 

Nearly 1 200 candidates from 19 parties were vying for 88 seats in the 
National Assembly two others being reserved for ethnic minorities. For the
first time there were no independent candidates. The quota for women 
candidates introduced in 2006 was applied for the first time. A 
transitional provision set a 25 per cent quota for 2008 increasing to 35 
per cent women candidates in 2012. Approximately one third of the 
registered candidates were women. Five candidates registered for the seat 
reserved for the Hungarian minority while four ran for the one reserved for
the Italian minority. 

The SD and the SDS in coalition with the NSi were the major parties in the 
2008 election campaign. The main election issues were taxes housing and 
border issues with Croatia.

Seven parties surpassed the 4 per cent threshold to win parliamentary 
representation. The final results gave the opposition SD ZARES LDS 
coalition a total of 43 seats. The SDS came in second with 28 seats but its
partner the NSi failed to win any parliamentary representation. 

Despite the quota the number of women members increased only by one 
bringing the total to 12. Only 41 outgoing members were re elected. Several
veteran MPs who had held their seats since the country gained independence
in 1991 were voted out. Among the members of the outgoing government only 
the Prime Minister and two ministers were returned to parliament.

(2) This study was conducted as a face-to-face post-election survey. The 
study sampling frame corresponds to the Central Register of Population 
(CRP) and includes all residents with permanent address, including both 
citizens and non-citizens. The study employed a stratified two-stage 
probability sampling method in which the primary sampling units (clusters 
of enumeration areas, CEA) were selected using the following procedure: 
first, the entire country was divided into about 9000 CEAs and stratified
according to 12 regions x 6 types of settlements. After this, fixed numbers
of CEA were selected inside each strata with probability proportional to 
size of CEA. In total 136 CEA were selected. Then 12 persons in each 
primary sampling unit were chosen by simple random sampling. Persons 
selected from Central Population Register were identified by name and 
address. Five contacts were made with the household before declaring it 
non-sample. The response rate was 64.0%. 

(3) There is no weight variable in this election study given that weights
are not necessary to make the population under study representative of 
the general population of Slovenia.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - SOUTH AFRICA (2009):
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) On 13 February 2009, President Motlanthe called elections for 22 April.
At stake were 400 seats in the National Assembly (lower chamber of 
parliament). Parliament was due to elect the country's new president after
the elections. Pursuant to the Government's 50:50 gender equality policy, 
the major parties endorsed more women candidates than in the previous 
elections. In all, 9,130 candidates, including 3,511 women, representing 
40 parties ran in the 2009 elections.

The ANC ran on its record, citing economic development and support for the
poor in the form of housing, water and electricity. Fighting corruption 
became a key electoral issue for opposition parties during the campaign. 
The ANC came under heavy criticism over corruption charges against Mr. 
Zuma, who had been accused of accepting bribes from a French arms company.
State prosecutors dropped the charges in April, two weeks before the 
elections.

The DA, led by Ms. Helen Zille, pledged to run a "clean" government. It
accused Mr. Zuma of having "bullied" the State prosecutors into withdrawing
the corruption charges and filed a legal challenge against the decision. It
promised to create more jobs, provide better education and tackle crime.

The COPE pledged to push for the reinstatement of the corruption charges
against Mr. Zuma. The COPE promised to fight crime by introducing a "three
strikes" policy, whereby career criminals would face life imprisonment for
repeat offences of rape, robbery or murder.

The IFP, founded in 1975 by Mr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi, campaigned on a 
platform to fight corruption and crime.

A total of 23,000 police officers and soldiers were deployed to ensure
security. The run-up to the election was relatively peaceful, although both
the ANC and the IFP alleged interference by the other party. The DA, the
COPE and the IFP all accused the ANC of vote buying and claimed that it had
distributed government food parcels during the campaign. The ANC dismissed
the allegation. The polls were monitored by 355 international observers and 
hailed as free and fair by the African Union (AU) and the Southern African 
Development Community (SADC). The AU praised the turnout but recommended 
that the Independent Electoral Commission find a solution to the problem
of long queues in future elections.

Thirteen parties won parliamentary representation. The ANC won 264 seats,
just short of the two-thirds majority. The DA and the COPE followed with 67
and 30 seats respectively. The IFP won 18 seats. Other parties took fewer
than four seats each.

(2) Post election interviews were conducted between October, 2nd and 31st
as face-to-face interviews. Specially trained translators therefore 
translated the original CSES questionnaire into ten languages (Afrikaans,
IsiXhosa / Xhosa, SePedi / North Sotho, SeSotho / South Sotho, SetTswana /
Tswana, Shangaan, Swazi, IsiZulu / Zulu, Venda, Ndebele). 

The underlying population of the current sample is South African adults 
aged 18 years and older, excluding institutionalized citizens, such as
military personnel. The sample is a random selection of households, 
proportional to the underlying population size. The primary sample units
were the Census enumerator areas, stratified by the nine provinces, the 
dominance of racial groups and the region of residence (urban vs. rural). 
In sum, this stratification yields 72 strata in which households were 
randomly selected. Within the households, all adult citizens were numbered,
whereas the head of the household randomly chose a number and thus selected
the person to be interviewed.

The South African interviewers were between 25 and 60 years old, all of 
them having a high school matriculation. Interviewers were trained by their
supervisors within the provinces. About 37% of the realized interviews were
verified by call-back. Overall, the response rate was about 48%.

(3) According to the slightly overrepresentation of citizens in the 
province of Northern Cape, as well as of the Indian race, a sample weight 
is included to adjust the underlying population.

 >>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - SOUTH KOREA (2008)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) The April 2008 elections were the first to be held under the country's
new President Lee Myung-bak of the Grand National Party (GNP), who was 
elected in December 2007. Prior to the 2008 elections, many new parties 
were formed. In August 2007, the Uri Party disbanded itself. Most of its 
parliamentarians joined the newly-created United New Democratic Party
(UNDP), along with five former Democratic Party (DP) members. In October,
other former Uri Party members formed the Renewal of Korea Party. After the
2007 presidential elections, the UNDP merged with the DP and renamed itself
the "United Democratic Party" (UDP), led by Mr. Son Hak-gyu, while the 
Liberty Forward Party (LFP) merged with the People First Party (PFP).

In late March, Ms. Park Geun-hye - daughter of former president Park Chung-
hee and former GNP chairwoman - complained of the elimination of many of 
her supporters in the GNP's selection of parliamentary candidates. Many of 
her loyalists left the GNP to form a new party, Park's Party, while Ms. 
Park herself remained in the GNP. The economy and employment figured 
prominently in the campaign. The UDP promised to create more jobs through 
economic growth.

It pledged to work towards affording greater protection to the country's 
low- and middle-income families. The GNP leader, Kang Jae-sup, called on 
voters' to retrieve "the 10 years the country lost under incompetent 
liberal governments". Its manifesto included university reforms that would 
give more autonomy to universities. The GNP won 153 seats, securing a 
majority in the National Assembly for the first time since 1998. The UDP 
took 81. The LFP came in third with 18 seats, followed by the Park's Party,
which took 14 seats. 

Around 30 elected GNP candidates were reportedly loyal to Ms. Park. The DLP 
took five seats while the NPP failed to win any. The Renewal of Korea Party 
won three seats. Only 46 per cent of the 37.8 million eligible voters 
turned out at the polls, down from 60 per cent recorded in the 2004 
elections."

(2) This study is a post-electoral, face-to-face study, conducted between 
April 10 and 21, 2008, immediately after the Parliamentary election of 
April 9, 2008. A multi-stage sampling procedure was employed: a) In a first
stage 80 electoral districts (PSUs) were on randomly chosen; b) Voting 
districts within each electoral districts were randomly sampled, and c) 
Sample of voters, within each voting district, were drawn from the list of 
voters provided by the Central Election Management Committee. The sample 
frame excluded Cheju island and other small islands, since people in these 
regions, who comprise a very small percentage of the total population 
(less than 0.5%), are difficult and costly to contact. 

(3) The original data, provided by South Korea, did not include weights; 
due to the sampling procedure, weights are not necessary to make the sample
representative for the whole South Korean population.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - SPAIN (2008)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) On 20 December 2007 Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero
announced that parliamentary elections would be held on 9 March. The 
bicameral parliament was subsequently dissolved on 14 January 2008. At 
stake were all 350 seats in the Congress of Deputies and the 208 directly 
elected seats in the 264-member Senate. 

As a result of a gender equality law all parties had a 50-50 gender 
balance for the candidates contesting the 2008 elections. Once again there 
was a duel between the PSOE and the PP. Due to the stagnating economy and a
12-year high inflation rate Mr. Rajoy (PP) accused the socialist government
of not taking enough measures to boost the economy. Prime Minister Zapatero
rebutted that his government was willing to use a budget surplus to revive
the economy. Both PSOE and the PP promised tax cuts. The PP also called for
a "contract" for immigrants. It argued that immigrants should respect
Spanish customs and values and should be expelled if they failed to find
work within a year of their arrival. 

Two days before the polls a former town councillor Mr. Isaias Carrasco of 
the PSOE was shot dead in the Basque region. Police blamed ETA for the 
shooting and the election campaign was briefly halted. 

The PSOE remained the largest party in the Congress of Deputies with 169 
seats followed by the PP with 153. The PP took 101 seats of the 208 
directly elected seats in the Senate 12 more than the PSOE. In all 127 
women were elected to the Congress of Deputies while 67 were elected to the
Senate.

(2) Interviews for the CSES survey took place in the period of April 11-21,
2008. The survey based on face-to-face interviews, on a random sample of
national citizens, aged 18 years and older, registered as voters. The 
sample frame covered approximately 99% of the total population, although it
excluded the two North African cities, Ceuta and Melilla, as well as 
institutionalized persons, at all. The interviews were distributed among 
the 17 Autonomous Regions in proportion to their population and to 
community size within each region. Municipalities with more than 500,000
inhabitants were all included, while the remaining units were randomly 
selected. Once the number of interviews to be done was established (by
size of community and autonomous region), a computerized system to randomly
extract municipalities and electoral sections was applied. The number of 
electoral sections was related to the total number of interviews to carry 
out in the municipality. Household selections based on a random route 
system. In case of refusal or non-contact, the interviewer went to the next
household. Age and sex quotas were used for respondent selection. These 
quotas were established in each sampling point according to the ration
between size of community and age and sex at the national level and 
regional level in the regions of Cataluña, Andalucía, and País Valenciano.
In the other regions, the distribution was proportional. Overall, the 
Spanish sample included 3954 households, out of which 1640 were not 
contactable. The responds rate was about 52.03%.

(3) The Spanish data include a demographic weight, which compensates for 
disproportionate probability of the sample selection. The construction of 
the weight bases on age and gender distribution of the studied population.

 >>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - SWEDEN (2006)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Sweden voted on 17 September 2006 to elect a new parliament. The 
country's membership of NATO and its generous welfare system were the main
electoral issues in 2006. While the SAP argued for maintenance of
neutrality, the Alliance for Sweden called for Swedish membership of NATO.
The Alliance pledged to reform Sweden's cradle-to-grave welfare policy by
cutting employers' taxes and unemployment benefits. The SAP accused the
opposition of wanting to destroy the welfare state. 

The SAP lost 14 seats, although it remained the largest party with 130
seats. Conversely, the Moderate Party increased its seats to 97, winning 42
more seats than in the 2002 elections. The FP, badly damaged by the hacking 
scandal, lost 20 seats, winning 28. The CP and the Kd won 29 and 24 seats 
respectively, thus giving the Alliance for Sweden a narrow majority in the 
new parliament with 178 seats. Prime Minister Göran Persson accepted defeat
and resigned on 17 September 2006. 

(Source: PARLINE database: http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/parline.htm) 

(2) The survey is part of a panel study of the Swedish National Elections 
Study, which has a two-step ongoing design in which half of the sample is 
interviewed in connection with the previous election, and the other half
in connection with the succeeding election. However, for the CSES data, 
only the post-election part of the panel is being used.

The sample is meant to be representative of all Swedish citizens living in
Sweden and who are entitled to vote. Respondents were randomly selected at 
all stages of the sampling procedures. Excluded from the sample frame were 
the estimated 2 percent of the total eligible population, who live abroad. 
1547 respondents were interviewed of which 870 answered the full 
questionnaire and 269 a shortened version. 408 respondents answered a very
shortened extract. Which version a respondent answered was captured in 
variable C1007. Also see the election study note on C1007.

(3) There are no post-survey adjustment weights, thus there are no weights
included in the data set.

 >>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - SWITZERLAND (2007)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) On 21 October 2007, elections were held for all 200 seats in the 
National Council and 41 of the 46 seats in the Council of States. The
SVP/UDC has moreover taken up its usual discourse of cutting taxes, 
keeping Switzerland out of the European Union and addressing the issue of
exploitation of the country's social and asylum policies. The election 
campaign was marked by an SVP/UDC poster showing a black sheep being kicked
out of Switzerland by three white sheep. Other parties also used their 
traditional election platforms, with the Socialists (SP/PS) calling for 
social security and solidarity, the Radical Democrats (FDP/PRD) urging 
further economic growth based on creativity and efficiency and the 
Christian Democrats (CVP/PDC) pledging to ensure job opportunities. 
The Greens (GPS/PES) campaigned for combating climate change, calling for
a ban on air shows in the country and the introduction of a jet fuel 
surcharge.

In the elections to the National Council, the SVP/UDC and the GPS/PES made
the biggest gains (seven seats each), bringing their seats to 62 and 20 
respectively. The SVP/UDC obtained the largest share of seats in this 
chamber since the country's proportional voting system started in 1919.
The SP/PS, which took 43 seats, suffered a major defeat, losing nine seats.
The FDP/PRD also lost five, winning 31 seats. The remainder went to small 
parties.

(2) This is a post-election study, focused on the Swiss parliamentary
election of October 21, 2007. The CSES survey module was conducted in three
languages (German, French and Italian) and as a combination of a telephone 
and follow-up self completion survey (which could be completed either by as
mail-back or online questionnaire). The follow-up survey was completed by 
all respondents from the telephone sample willing to answer a supplementary
self-administered questionnaire. See variable C1007 to identify each sample
component. Total panel attrition was 27.59%. Sample for the telephone 
survey was drawn from the telephone register of households selected by the 
federal office of statistics. The sample had three components: a) A 
national sample of households with 2000 target respondents; b) An over-
sample in cantons (which correspond to the electoral districts) used to 
guarantee at least 100 respondents in each; c) An over-sample in 3 cantons 
used to guarantee at least 600 respondents in each (corresponding to 
Tessin, Zurich and Geneva). Within each household, respondents were 
randomly selected. Notice that the CSES module was only applied in sample 
(a) and (b), thus respondents from sample (c) in not included in the data 
set. Additionally, one canton (containing approximately 0.6% of the total 
population) was excluded from the sample since there was only one 
candidate, and thus, no election took place.


(3) The Swiss study includes two different weights. The first one is a
design weight that adjusts for oversampling of certain cantons (see point
2 for details of the sample design). The second weight is a cumulative
political weight that adjusts for sample bias in turnout and party choice
variables, in addition to the cantonal oversampling.

 >>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - TAIWAN (2008)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Unlike the past four presidential elections, the presidency in 2008 
was contested by candidates from just the two major parties.

With incumbent President Chen Shui-bian prevented by the constitutional 
term limit - two consecutive four-year terms - from running again,
the DPP fielded two veteran heavyweight politicians, Frank Hsieh and Su
Tseng-chang, as their presidential and vice-presidential candidates.
Hsieh won the DPPs primary, triumphing over several other senior DPP
politicians. 

For the KMT, the charismatic former mayor of Taipei Ma Ying-jeou and former
economic affairs minister Vincent Siew were chosen to represent the party.

Two months after the KMTs landslide victory in the legislative elections,
its candidate Ma Ying-jeou won a decisive victory in the presidential
election. The KMTs resounding victory has been attributed to Ma 
Ying-jeous unsullied image, the unpopularity of the incumbent President
Chen, and voters weariness with the political stalemate and deadlock
of the past eight years.

the past? Electoral Studies 28, 492-517. (quoted are: 503-504; 505-506)).

(2) The sample is meant to be representative of eligible voters in Taiwan's
2008 presidential election. Taiwanese citizens are eligible from 20 years
of age onwards. Institutionalized persons were excluded from the sample 
frame.

For the sampling, the country was divided into six geographic regions,
then the proportions of samples for each region was estimated. 
73 single-member districts of the 2008 legislative election served as
primary sampling units (PSU). 

The secondary sampling units are villages or "li" and then, respondents
were systematically drawn from household registration list provided by
the Ministry of Interior. Based on the principle of probabilities 
proportional to the size (PPS), a total of 1,905 interviews  were 
completed. Around 16 respondents were sampled from every selected village 
or li.

(3) To generalize to the population of eligible voters
in the 2008 presidential election, the survey data should be weighted by 
ranking with gender, age (5 groups), education (5 groups), and area 
(6 regions). The demographic characteristics are based on "2007
Taiwan-Fuchien Demographic Fact Book Republic of China", published by the
Ministry of Interior Republic of China.

 >>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - THAILAND (2007)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) The December 2007 elections were the first to be held following a 
military takeover in September 2006 which ousted the then Prime Minister, 
Shinawatra Thaksin. The adoption of a new Constitution on 19 August 2007
opened the way to a  return to democracy. At stake in the 2007 elections 
were the 480 seats in  the new House of Representatives. 

The TRT had been dissolved by the Constitutional Tribunal in May 2006, and 
exiled former prime minister Thaksin was barred from running in the 2007 
elections, along with 111 former TRT executives. Mr. Thaksin's supporters 
formed the People's Power Party (PPP) prior to the elections, whose 
candidates included children of barred former TRT members. The PPP leader 
Mr. Samak Sundaravej pledged to allow Mr. Thaksin's return to the country 
so he could "prove his innocence". The PPP promised to give priority to 
economic recovery. 

The Democratic Party (DP, which took 96 seats in the 2005 elections), was 
led by Mr. Abhisit Vejjajiva. It pledged to fight corruption and improve 
the country's economic situation within 99 days. Its leader said his party 
would not join a PPP-led government. 

Preliminary results gave the PPP 233 seats and the DP 165 seats, although 
the results for several seats were invalidated following allegations of 
vote-buying.

(2) The post election interviewing began at January 9, 2008, and ran until 
January 31, 2008, as face-to-face interviews. The current sample population
was meant to be representative of all eligible Thai voters, aged 18 years 
and older and having the Thai citizenship. However, Thailand's electoral 
law excludes monks, novices, Brahmin priests and clergies from the right to
vote. The sample was selected in a three-stage probability sample process. 
Based upon clusters of legislative districts, voting units have been 
selected in which voters were chosen by systematic sampling based on voter 
lists. Overall, out of the 145 legislative districts of Thailand, 50 have 
been selected, including 100 voting units in total. The respondents had not 
been informed before the first contact for an interview. Prior to the 
interview, a small gift (a pen) was given to respondents. Detailed 
information about the interviewer, their gender, age, training or any 
instruction were not available.

(3) The original data, provided by Thailand, did not include any kind of
weights. Furthermore, due to the sampling procedure, weights are not 
necessary to make the sample representative for the whole Thai population.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - TURKEY (2011):
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) On 3 March 2011, the Grand National Assembly of Turkey adopted a 
proposal by the Justice and Development Party (AKP) for elections to be 
held on 12 June, two months earlier than constitutionally due.

In 2011, Prime Minister Erdogan was seeking to win a third term in office.
His party's main rivals were the CHP, led by Mr. Kemal Kilicdaroglu, and
the MHP, led by Mr. Devlet Bahceli. In all, 15 parties and 200 independent
candidates were vying for seats. Political parties need to win over 10 per
cent of the valid votes nationwide, while independent candidates need to
win over 10 per cent of the valid votes in the province where they stand
for election. On 14 May, the Prime Minister announced that drafting a new 
constitution would be his key priority after the 2011 elections. The 
country's current Constitution was written shortly after the September 
1980 military coup. Erdogan urged voters to give the AKP the two-thirds
majority (367 seats) required to modify the Constitution.

The opposition CHP criticized the Prime Minister for what it termed
despotic ambitions. It argued that the new constitution should be drafted
in consultation with all parties. It urged voters to support the CHP to
prevent the AKP from drafting the new constitution single-handedly. The CHP
presented its own draft constitution, promising to ensure more rights for
minorities. 

The MHP promised to work for national unity, which, in its view, had been
threatened by the AKP government's overtures towards the Kurds.

In the run-up to polling day, many Syrian refugees fleeing a crackdown
crossed Turkey's southern border. On 8 June, Prime Minister Erdogan said
that Turkey would not close its borders to refugees coming from Syria.

Transparent plastic ballot boxes were used for the first time instead of
the wooden boxes used previously, in a move to prevent fraud.

Three parties secured the required 10 per cent of the valid votes
nationwide to win parliamentary representation. The AKP won 326 seats, 41
short of the two-thirds majority. The CHP increased its share from 112 to
135 seats. Inversely, the MHP saw its share reduced from 71 to 53 seats.
Thirty-six independent candidates, including 35 backed by the BDP, were
elected. In all, 78 women were elected.

On 22 June, the Supreme Election Board cancelled the parliamentary mandate
of nine MPs-elect. They had campaigned from prison: six independent
candidates backed by the BDP, two CHP members and one MHP member. The
Constitution stipulates that persons sentenced to prison terms of one year
or more cannot be elected to parliament. The said MPs-elect were all
serving prison terms exceeding one year. Many opposition members announced
that they would boycott the swearing-in of the newly elected parliament
unless all the jailed deputies were allowed to join parliament.

(2) The Turkish survey for the current CSES module was administrated
between July, 21st and August 26th 2011, as face to face interviews. The
target population of sample was non-institutionalized Turkish citizens,
aged 18 years and older, excluding about 2.4% of the overall population.

The sampling procedure adopted starts with the use of Turkish Statistical
Institutes (TUIK) NUT-1 regions. The target sample was distributed
according to each regions share of urban and rural population in
accordance with the Address Based Population Registration System (ADNKS)
records as of the end of 2010. Next, TUIKs block data were used with block
size set at 400 residents. Twenty voters were targeted to be reached from
each block and no substitution was used. The probability proportionate to
population size (PPPS) principle was used in distributing the blocks to
NUT1 regions. For each of the 20 addresses up to three visits were carried
out with the expectation that approximately 50% of the addresses will have
a completed interview. In some rural areas where TUIK was unable to provide
addresses we contacted the headman (Muhtar) of the village and obtained 20
addresses in a systematic random sample selection from the list of
households in the village. Selection of individuals in households is done
on the basis of reported target population of 18 years or older in each
household according to a lottery method. Names of all reported individuals
of 18 years or older are written on cards and a person in the household
then is asked to randomly select one card with the name of the individual
to be interviewed.

Interviewers were between 20 to 45 years old with higher levels of
education. They were trained in house by the Turkish researchers. About one
third of the realized interviews were verified by phone calls, In addition,
another 20% of the interviews were supervised during the fieldwork. In
total 2440 households were sampled, out of which 2102 addresses remained as
valid households. In 1109 of them interviews were successfully completed,
i.e. the response rate was about 52.76%.

(3) The Turkish subsample of the CSES includes a demographic weight to
control for a selection bias. It bases on the total populations
distribution according to three age groups (18-34, 35-54 and 55+), gender,
and six educational levels (illiterate, literate but no school completed,
primary 5 years, primary 8 years, high school, and university graduates).

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - UNITED STATES (2008):
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) The November 2008 congressional elections were held jointly with the
presidential elections. At stake were all 435 seats in the House of 
Representatives and 35 seats in the Senate. 

The 2008 elections were held against the backdrop of a financial crisis, 
the worst since the 1929 Great Depression. The budget deficit hit a record
US$ 455 billion in the fiscal year ending in September 2008. 

Both the Democrats and the Republicans focused on stabilizing the US 
economy. Other main issues included the deployment of US troops overseas 
and health care reform. 

In the elections to the House of Representatives the Democrats won 257 
seats while Republicans took 178. In the Senate elections the Democrats
won 20 seats to hold 59 seats in all (including support from two
independents) while Republicans took 15 (41 in all).  In the 
presidential elections Mr. Obama secured 53 per cent of the popular
vote (or 365 votes in the electoral college) becoming the first African 
American person to accede to the highest office in the USA.

(2) The 2008 American National Election Study is a pre-, post-election 
survey. It was conducted on a multi- stage area probability sample intended
to be representative of the United States. The entire target population 
constitutes all English- and Spanish-speaking citizens of voting age. The 
ample was conducted using a five stage sampling process: a primary stage
sampling of U.S. Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) and non-MSA
counties, followed by a second stage sampling of census tracts (CTs). A
third stage sampling referred to Census block groups (CBGs), containing 550
household on average. In a fourth stage, these blocks were controlled for 
valid residential mailing addresses. Finally, respondents were selected 
within the sampled household, based on a stratification of Latinos, African
American and others. 

Pre-election interviews were conducted September 2 through November 3,
2008. The post-election interviews were held between November, 5th and
December, 30th. On average a period of 54 days lied in between both 
interviewing dates, with maximum of 116 days. Variables, included in the
CSES surveyed in the pre- (socio-demographics) and post-election (survey
variables) interviews. Overall, 116 interviews were hired for the post-
election survey, out of which 24 persons were trained bilingual. 100% of
the completed questionnaires were verified, based on audio records of the
interviews.

(3) The US data include a sample weight to make the post-election survey 
representative for the US target population. Based on age and education, it
controls for a sampling bias, caused by non-response.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - URUGUAY (2009)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) At stake in the 2009 elections were all 99 seats in the House of
Representatives and the 30 seats in the Senate. They were held in parallel
with the presidential elections.

In March 2009, the General Assembly (Senate plus House of Representatives) 
approved a law to increase the percentage of women on the candidates' lists
for elections at all levels. However, it will only apply as of the 
parliamentary elections due in 2014.  

In the 2009 elections, Senator José Mujica was elected in Preliminary 
Elections as FA presidential candidate. A former member of the rebel 
Tupamaros National Liberation Movement (MLN), he was challenged by former 
president Luis Alberto Lacalle (PN) and Mr. Pedro Bordaberry (PC).
The FA pledged to solve housing problems, create jobs and fight poverty.

The PN pledged to work for security, employment and independence. It also
promised to remove the income tax introduced by the FA government.

PC leader Bordaberry promised a lower tax burden for people and promised to
establish a merit-based pay system.

The FA retained the majority in both chambers, taking 50 seats in the House
of Representatives and 16 in the Senate. The PN took 30 and nine seats
respectively. The PC followed with 17 and five. The PI, led by Mr. Pablo
Mieres, obtained two seats in the House of Representatives. Fourteen women
were elected to the House of Representatives and four to the Senate.
No candidate won the required majority in the presidential elections to be
elected in the first round. The run-off elections between Mr. Mujica (FA)
and Mr. Lacalle (PN), backed by the PC, were held on 29 November. Mr.
Mujica (FA) was elected with over 52 per cent of the votes.

        collaborators)

(2) Face-to-face interviews took place between August 13th and August 31st,
2010. The sampling process required the Uruguayan citizenship, as well as a
minimum age of 18 years. The sample relies on three primary units, the
department of Montevideo (400 cases), the metropolitan area of Montevideo
(97 cases) and the rest of the country, including 18 further departments
(471 cases), reflecting the overall distribution of Uruguayan citizens.
Based these three areas, household sampling was randomly, whereat
respondents selection with a chosen household rested up on the Kish grid
method. Interviewers contacted each household only once and declared it as
non-sampled after an unsuccessful effort.
In sum, 30 interviewers participated throughout Uruguay. All of them were
university students, trained for the CSES interviews in personal sessions.
Survey verifications included about 15% of the interviews, by telephone
checking.
A total of 968 interviews were completed.

(3) A political weight relies on corrections according to the official
election results. It is based on the electoral outcome of the parliamentary 
and presidential elections and controls for the distribution of 
C3023_LH_PL. (For further details, see CSES Design Report for Uruguay 
2009.)
