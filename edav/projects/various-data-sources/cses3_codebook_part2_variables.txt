         | NOTES: C1008
         |
         | The official period covered in Module 3 is from 
         | 2006 to 2011. The questionnaire was finalized for data collection
         | beginning in 2006, however we include three pilot studies from 
         | 2005, namely Germany (2005), Norway (2005) and Poland (2005).

         Respondent identifier.
         ..................................................................

             This variable is ten characters in length.  It is unique
             for each survey respondent within an election.


         | NOTES: C1009
         |
         | While this variable uniquely identifies a respondent within
         | an election study, it is not unique across the entire dataset.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - FINLAND (2011): C1009
         | 
         | The first digit of respondents' unique id variable reflects the 
         | language of the interviewing, as explained in the election study
         | note on C1007.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - TAIWAN (2008): C1009
         | 
         | The unique respondent identifier provided with the Taiwan (2008)
         | study was too long to be included in this variable. It was not
         | possible to find an algorithm to convert it to a variable that
         | fit within the same length as the CSES variable.  Therefor, a
         | respondent identifier for Taiwan (2008) was created that is
         | unique to CSES, but unfortunately does not allow analysts to
         | merge the CSES dataset back to the original Taiwan (2008)
         | election study.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

         | NOTES: C1010
         |
         | These variables report the original weights provided with
         | the respective deposited data files.
         |
         | Sample weights include those intended to correct for unequal
         | selection probabilities resulting from "booster" samples,
         | procedures for selection within the household, non-response,
         | as well as other features of the sample design.
         |
         | Demographic weights adjust sample distributions of socio-
         | demographic characteristics to more closely resemble the
         | characteristics of the population.
         |
         | Political weights reconcile discrepancies in the reported
         | electoral behavior of the survey respondents from the
         | official vote counts.
         |
         | In cases where a collaborator provides a single weight that
         | is a combination of one or more of the three weight categories
         | (sample, demographic, and political), the weight is duplicated
         | in the two or more appropriate variables.  Thus, analysts using
         | two or more of the weights simultaneously will need to account
         | for this duplication.
         |
         | Use of weights is at the discretion of the analyst based upon
         | the considerations of her/his individual research question.
         | We recommend that analysts familiarize themselves with the
         | weights, their components, and their methods of creation
         | before applying them.
         |
         | Additionally, analysts will want to keep in mind that these
         | weights are prepared to be election study weights, not country
         | weights. To convert the weights to country weights requires an
         | adjustment for those countries for which one or more polities
         | or election studies appear in the dataset.
         |
         | Where a weight of a particular type is not available, these
         | variables are coded 1.
         |
         | Collaborators provided the original weights with a varying
         | number of decimal places. In this CSES dataset, however, all
         | of the original weights have been rounded to four decimal
         | places at maximum (i.e. 1.1234) using STATA.

         | Because of non-response the sample is not an exact
         | representation in terms of equal distribution of known
         | demographic characteristics of the Austrian population. 
         | A demographic sample weight is included that adjusts sample 
         | characteristics to known population estimates, which were taken
         | from census data carried out by Statistics Austria.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - BRAZIL (2006): C1010_2
         |
         | The election study has been weighed to correct for demographic
         | characteristics of the population as reported in the official
         | demographic census PNAD2003. Weights were calculated on basis 
         | of 1000 respondents.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - CANADA (2008): C1010_1
         |
         | In order to produce national estimates it is advisable to 
         | correct for both the unequal probabilities of selection at the
         | household stage and the unequal probabilities of selection based
         | on province of residence. The National Weight is the product of
         | the household weight and the provincial weight and should be
         | used when national estimates are required. 
         |
         | The aforementioned National Weight was provided by the Canada
         | collaborators only for respondents who were participating for
         | the first time in the 2008 study (C1007=1-3). The 1238 panel
         | respondents carried forward from past studies (C1007=4-5) 
         | were assigned a weight of zero (0) for the variable by the
         | Canadian collaborators. Thus, any time that the weight
         | is used, the panel respondents will be dropped out of the
         | analysis. To get around this, the CSES Secretariat assigned
         | to the 1238 panel respondents a weight which is the mean of
         | the weights used for the remainder of the (non-panel) 
         | respondents in the Canada (2008) study.
         
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - CHILE (2009): C1010_2
         |
         | The sample was designed with the proportions of the population
         | in terms of sex and age as registered on the electoral district         
         | and occupation. The weight corrects sex and age for the national                
         | distributions of the registered voters.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - CROATIA (2007): C1010_2
         |
         | A weight has to be used to control for the demographic marginal 
         | (region, settlement, size, sex, age, etc.). The weight has been 
         | calculated on the base of the Croatian Census data of 2001.
          
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - CROATIA (2007): C1010_3
         |       
         | A weight is necessary to control for the political
         | marginal (region, settlement, size, sex, age, education) 
         | according to the election results. The weight has been 
         | calculated on the base of the Croatian Census data of 2001.
 
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - DENMARK (2007): C1010_1
         |       
         | Researchers should note that the original Danish
         | data contains of two subsamples, as explained in the codebook 
         | introduction. The employed sample weight (C1010_1) depends on 
         | both subsamples. Consequently, the exclusion of the web-panel 
         | part of the Danish data might slightly bias this weight.
         | See also description of the Danish sampling process in the 
         | introduction part of the current CSES codebook. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - ESTONIA (2011): C1010_2
         |
         | A weight combining gender, ethnicity, region and rural-urban
         | nature of settlement was calculated based on data from the 
         | Population Register. No subpopulation was purposefully 
         | oversampled. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - FINLAND (2011): C1010_3
         | 
         | The Finnish data include a political weight, controlling for the
         | electoral outcome of the parliament election in 2011 
         | (C3023_LH_PL). Its effect on other variables in the CSES is only 
         | marginal.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - FRANCE (2007): C1010_1
         |
         | This weight controls for unequal probabilities of selection, 
         | especially due to random draw in households of unequal size, 
         | defined as the product of the probability of selection of the 
         | i-th observation in its PSU and the corresponding probability of
         | selecting this observation in its household.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - FRANCE (2007): C1010_2
         |
         | The demographic weight is designed to match the population 
         | distribution on gender, age, education, occupation and 
         | household size.
         |
         | All these variables have been considered in their French 
         | definition, which do not match international classifications. 
         | Existence of bias after weighting depends on these various 
         | definitions of categories.
         |
         | The CSES Secretariat is aware that some of the minimum values
         | of the weight are very low (0.0001) compared to the maximum
         | values of the weight (23.0556) but this was determined to be
         | intentional by the collaborator.
         
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - FRANCE (2007): C1010_3
         |
         | The political weight controls for political skewness, computed
         | to correct for a bias on the aggregate electoral results of 
         | legislative elections. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GERMANY (2005): C1010_1
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GERMANY (2009): C1010_1
         |
         | Due to the German history, the eastern part of the country is 
         | over-sampled. To study Germany as a whole, C1010_1 is needed to 
         | correct for this kind of the sample selection. 
         | In addition, C1010_1 also controls for skewness in relevant 
         | socio-demographic characteristics within each of the German 
         | federal state, as it is done by C1010_2.
         | In contrast, researchers interested in comparing both parts of
         | Germany separately, should not make use of C1010_1.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GERMANY (2005): C1010_2
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GERMANY (2009): C1010_2
         |
         | According to drop-outs, non-responds and incomplete interviews,
         | C1010_2 controls for potential skewness in relevant socio-
         | demographic characteristics. The weight corrects for age-groups
         | and sex within each region. To study Germany as whole, C1010_1 
         | has to be used exclusively to control for the over-sampling of 
         | East Germany as well as for potential skewness of socio-
         | demographic characteristic. Consequently, a combination of both 
         | weights is not necessary.
  
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GREECE (2009): C1010_3
         |
         | The weight is based on vote in current elections: Each voter of
         | party i is weighted by Wi=VSi/PRi, where VSi is the vote share 
         | of party i and PRi is the proportion of respondents in the data 
         | file who have responded that they have voted for party i. 
         
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - HONG KONG (2008): C1010_2
         |
         | A sample weight is included to correct for skewness in the

         | As the implementation of the CSES Module 3 points out, Japan 
         | used two different samples. Consequently a weight is necessary
         | to make the sample representative of the population being 
         | studied and to compensate bias of potential skewness in relevant
         | demographic factors. The weight included in the original data
         | file was constructed by strata of six layers of age (20s, 30s,
         | 40s, 50s, 60s, and over 70) and gender, based on the frequencies
         | of Population Census of Japan 2005.

         | Since the sample is equally allocated across the four major
         | areas (National Capital Region or NCR, the rest of Luzon

         | the Portuguese National Statistics Office Census 2001. 
         | In the source file, 13 cases had system missing values in the 
         | weight variable. The reason is that in these cases, at least one
         | variable used to calculate the weight (gender, age and

         | on the basis of the samples appearing in the CSES data files
         | (i.e. does not incorporate booster samples, panel respondents
         | who did not participate in the CSES wave of multi-wave studies,
         | etc.). Further, this factor treats elections, and not political
         | systems, as the unit of analysis. Analysts wishing to compare
         | across-countries, instead of across-election studies, should
         | adjust this weight accordingly.
         |
         | The resulting factor is then used to create the derivative
         | "Dataset Weights" in variables C1014_1 through C1014_3.

         |
         | Due to the compulsory school attendance, covering pupils aged 
         | 6 to 15, a category for 1 "no education" was not used in the
         | German questionnaire. Researchers interested in the German 
         | compulsory school attendance should take note that Germany 
         | is a federal state and that the regulations for education 
         | are in the hand of the federal state governments.
         | Hence, the length of compulsory education may vary across 
         | federal states. 
         | Furthermore, code 4 "incomplete secondary" was not in use in 
         | Germany. People who have not achieved the minimum level of 
         | qualification normally required to enter university are instead 
         | coded as 3 "primary completed". 
         | Finally it has to be noted, that Germany distinguishes between 
         | two different types of university, a general university as well 
         | as an university of applied sciences and an university of 
         | engineering.
         | The classification of these types of educational institutes to 
         | the CSES codes are:
         |

         |        08.     University undergraduate degree completed  
         |                including persons having achieved a minimum level

         |                the German diploma.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GERMANY (2009): C2003
         |
         | To classify respondent's level of education Germany used a 
         | modified scheme of the ISCED-1997. First, the CSES level 
         | 4 INCOMPLETE SECONDARY was replaced by the ISCED-code 2 for
         | LOWER SECONDARY. In detail, this category includes people with 
         | a full implementation of basic skills, entering after some 6 
         | years of primary education, or those who left school after the 
         | compulsory education, ending after 9 years since the beginning of 
         | primary education. 
         |
         | Second, the CSES category 5 SECONDARY COMPLETED was replaced by 
         | the ISCED category 3 HIGHER SECONDARY, covering respondents, who
         | have at least the minimum qualifications normally required to 
         | enter into university, or any other degree level of higher 
         | education, but who have never entered a university or other 
         | degree level course of higher education. 
         | Finally, according to the compulsory schooling in Germany, the
         | use of CSES categories 2 INCOMPLETE PRIMARY and 3 COMPLETE 
         | PRIMARY is not applicable.

         | Note that in the Icelandic election Study respondents were asked
         | three questions regarding education:
         | a) if he/she was attending school,
         | b) at what degree/education respondent had finished and
         | c) if respondent had started a school or studying for a degree
         |    but not finished (dropped out).
         | The response categories for each question were a list of 54
         | different degrees or level of education and possibility to write
         | in an explanation about respondent's education. These variables
         | were then used to calculate the education level as used by CSES. 
         | Due to a coding problem there may be single cases of persons
         | on a vocational training who already hold a university degree,
         | which is not reported.

         |  2. Achieving a high school diploma, and
         |  3. The highest school degree respondent's has earned.

         | NOTES: C2004
         |
         | This variable reports the respondent's current marital
         | status. For instance, a person who is both divorced and
         | living together as married would be coded 1.
         |
         | Note that C2004 is a filter question for spouses' occupational 
         | variables (C2015 through C2019), which was not applied for all 
         | countries in the final release of the CSES. For more details 
         | see Elections Study Notes, below, as well as Election Study 
         | Notes on C2015 through C2019.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - BRAZIL (2010): C2004
         | 
         | The Brazilian election study distinguished between more
         | categories which were collapsed to the CSES standard as follows:
         |
         | CSES Code      Election Study Code/Category
         |        01.     Married 
         |                Lives together
         |        02.     Widowed
         |        03.     Divorced
         |                Separated
         |        04.     Bachelor 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - FRANCE (2007): C2004
         |
         | The original marital status variable had separate response
         | categories for 'Married' ("Marié(e)"), 'Living together
         | as married' ("Vit en concubinage") and PACSÉ, (Pacte Civil de 
         | solidarité) which is a contractual partnership between 2 people
         | of legal age to organize their life in common.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - ICELAND (2007): C2004
         |
         | Note that one respondent reported not to be married in C2004,
         | but presented occupational information for a spouse in C2015 
         | through C2019. This may be due to some problem with 
         | interviewing. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - IRELAND (2007): C2004
         |
         | Note that in Ireland C2004 lays emphasis on the legal status
         | of marriage, thereby under-representing in code 1 those who
         | are not married, but are living together as married.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NETHERLANDS (2006): C2004
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NETHERLANDS (2010): C2004
         | 
         | As most of the demographic variables, the marital status  
         | variable has been added to the data-file by Statistics 
         | Netherlands on the basis of population records. Therefore, the 
         | variable is based on the legal definition of being married or in 
         | registered partnership. As a result, there is a number of 
         | respondents coded as not married in V422 but also as having "a 
         | partner that is a  member of the household" according to V440 
         | (the variable based on interview records). 
         | In order to bring this variable closer to the CSES definition of
         | C2004, respondents with a partner in household were coded as 
         | "1." in C2004 regardless of their code in the original marital
         | status variable, unless they were coded "2. Single" or "7. 
         | Parent in single parent household" in variable "V423 Place of 
         | respondent in household". In the latter case the cases remained
         | in their original marital status categories. 
         | Note that this adjustment reduces the skip pattern inconsistency
         | between C2004 and variables dealing with spouse's socioeconomic
         | status (C2015), but does not eliminate it.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SLOVAKIA (2010): C2004
         |
         | Note that category 3, "divorced or separated" were two
         | separate code categories in the Slovakian Election Study.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SLOVENIA (2008): C2004
         |
         | Note that the Slovenian data include several respondents that

         | In contrast living together with a partner was asked in a single
         | variable. The combination of both equates the given category 
         | "01. Married or Living Together as Married".
         | The combination yields some cases that mentioned  
         | widowed (eleven cases), divorced (90 cases) or single (244 
         | cases), but are living together with a (new) partner. These 345

         | Note that round 21% of respondents in a trade union also report
         | membership in an employer's association. This could be partly
         | due to the similarity of the words employer and employee in the
         | Czech language. Some respondents may thus have misunderstood

         |
         | 2. Worker:
         | Broad occupational grouping of workers engaged in manual labor.
         |
         | 3. Farmer:
         | Normally persons self-employed in farming.
         |
         | 4. Self-Employed:
         | Self-employed occupations of all kinds, excluding self-employed
         | farming. Includes, for example entrepreneurs, shop keeper,

         | Note that there is some inconsistency between studies in the way
         | the responses to the questions about current employment status 
         | (C2010) affected the application of the follow-up occupation 
         | variables (C2011-C2014). The CSES standard is that the 
         | occupation variables are asked from those in labor force. 
         | However, in some cases, for respondents categorized as not in 
         | labor force in C2010 (codes 6-12) the occupation variables may 
         | report respondent's last occupation. Hence, the responses 
         | concerning occupation that belong to respondents not in labor 
         | force presumably reflect their previous or last occupation.

         | coded as missing.

         | Note that there is some inconsistency between studies in the way
         | the responses to the questions about current employment status 
         | (C2010) affected the application of the follow-up occupation 
         | variables (C2011-C2014). The CSES standard is that the 
         | occupation variables are asked from those in the labor force. 
         | However, in some cases, for respondents categorized as not in 
         | the labor force in C2010 (codes 6-12) the occupation variables  
         | may report respondent's last occupation. Hence, the responses 
         | concerning occupation that belong to respondents not in the  
         | labor force presumably reflect their previous or last 
         | occupation.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NORWAY (2009): C2013
         |
         | Note that respondent's employment type was asked irrespectively

         | out of the labor force were asked about their previous 
         | occupation.

         | In this more detailed ILO occupation coding all four-digit codes

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - UNITED STATES (2008): C2013
         |
         | Note that the US question on the employment type differs from 
         | the CSES manner. C2013 sets up on two questions, asking "Are 
         | you employed by a federal, state or local government?" (v083237)
         | and "Were you employed by a federal, state or local 
         | government?" (v083230).
         |  1. Respondents who are actually in labor force (C2010<6) were 
         |     coded according to v083237, as
         |      "1. public sector", if the answer on v083237 was "yes";
         |      "2. private sector", if the answer on v083237 was "no" or 
         |          "not applicable";
         |      "7. refused", if the answer on v083237 was "refused"
         |  2. Respondents who are actually not in labor force (C2010>5) 
         |     were coded according to v083230, as 
         |      "1. public sector", if the answer on v083230 was "yes";
         |      "2. private sector", if the answer on v083230 was "no"; 
         |      "7. refused", if the answer on v083237 was "refused";
         |      "8. don't know", if the answer on v083237 was "don't know".
         | Consequently, C2013 allows distinguishing only between the "1. 
         | public sector" and "2. private sector". There are no categories 
         | for "3. mixed sector" or "4. third sector" in the US data.

         | Note that there is some inconsistency among studies in the way
         | the responses to the questions about current employment status 
         | (C2010) affected the application of the follow-up occupation 
         | variables (C2011-C2014). The CSES standard is that the 
         | occupation variables are asked from those in the labor force. 
         | However, in some cases, for respondents categorized as not in 
         | labor force in C2010 (codes 6-12), the occupation variables may 
         | report respondent's last occupation. Hence, the responses 
         | concerning occupation that belong to respondents not in labor 
         | force presumably reflect their previous or last occupation.

         | training program are coded EMPLOYED.
         | 
         | Note that there is some inconsistency among studies in the way
         | responses to the questions about current employment status 
         | of spouses (C2015) were administered, affecting the application
         | of the follow-up occupation variables (C2016-C2019). The CSES 
         | standard is that the occupation variables are asked for those in 
         | the labor force. However, in some cases, for spouses categorized 
         | as not in the labor force in C2015 (codes 6-12), the occupation 
         | variables may report their previous or last occupation. 
         | 
         | There is variation in the manner in which the questions about
         | respondent's spouse were administered in different election
         | studies. In some cases only those categorized as "married or
         | living together" in C2004 were asked the spouse questions,
         | while in some surveys other responses could also lead to a 
         | respondent being asked these questions. Consequently C2015 
         | sometimes includes information of spouses from respondents
         | who reported neither being married nor living together with a 
         | partner (C2004 is not code 1.). These data remained unchanged.

         | In contrast to the general CSES guidelines, C2015 was only 
         | asked for spouses, if the respondents was not the main earner of

         | much.
         | Furthermore, the original categories used in the Swiss

         |
         | See also notes for variable C2015.
         |
         | (1) This variable reports the respondent's spouse's main
         | occupation; that is, the job at which the respondent's
         | spouse spends most of the time, or if the respondent's
         | spouse spends an equal amount of time on two jobs, it is
         | the one from which the respondent's spouse earns the most
         | money.  For spouses who are currently employed, this variable
         | reports their current occupation. For spouses who are retired
         | or not currently working, this variable reports the spouse's
         | last occupation.
         |
         | (2) Coding conventions employ the first two-digits of 1988
         | ISCO / ILO International Standard Classification of
         | Occupations Code from the International Labor Office, CH-1211,
         | Geneva 22, Switzerland.
         |
         | In some cases it has not been possible to strictly adhere to the
         | ISCO/ILO conventions. Users will find that some categories have
         | been added to the ISCO/ILO list in order to accommodate the
         | occupations of respondents who were not easily classified.
         | Please refer to specific Election Study Notes for clarification 
         | of additional codes.
         | 
         | There is variation in the ways in which the questions about
         | respondent's spouse were administered in different election
         | studies. In some cases only those categorized as "married or
         | living together" in C2004 were asked the spouse questions,
         | while in some surveys other responses could also lead to a 
         | respondent being asked these questions. Consequently C2016 
         | sometimes includes information of spouses from respondents who
         | reported neither being married nor living together with a 
         | partner (C2004 is not code 1.). These data remained unchanged.

         | on C2004.

         |
         | 1. White Collar:
         | Broad occupational grouping of workers engaged in non-manual
         | labor: Managers, salaried professionals, office workers, 
         | sales personnel, and proprietors are generally included in 
         | the category.
         |
         | 2. Worker:
         | Broad occupational grouping of workers engaged in manual labor.
         |
         | 3. Farmer:
         | Normally persons self-employed in farming.
         |
         | 4. Self-Employed:
         | Self-employed occupations of all kinds, excluding self-employed
         | farming. Included, for example, entrepreneurs, shopkeeper,
         | professionals, such as lawyers, medical doctors etc.

         | There is variation in the manner the questions about
         | respondent's spouse were administered in different election
         | studies. In some cases only those categorized as "married or
         | living together" in C2004 were asked the spouse questions,
         | while in some surveys other categories could also get these
         | questions (see Election Study Notes).
         | Moreover that there is some inconsistency among studies in the 
         | way the responses to the questions about current employment 
         | status of souses (C2015) affected the application of the follow-
         | up occupation variables (C2017-C2019). The CSES standard is that
         | the occupation variables are asked from those in the labor 
         | force. However, in some cases, for spouses categorized as not in
         | labor force in C2015 (codes 6-12), the occupation variables may 
         | report respondent's last occupation. Hence, the responses 
         | concerning occupation that belong to respondents not in labor 
         | force presumably reflect their previous or last occupation.

         |
         | There is variation in the manner the questions about
         | respondent's spouse were administered in different election
         | studies. In some cases only those categorized as "married or
         | living together" in C2004 were asked the spouse questions,
         | while in some surveys other categories could also get these
         | questions. (see Election Study Notes).
         | Moreover that there is some inconsistency among studies in the 
         | way the responses to the questions about current employment 
         | status of souses (C2015) affected the application of the follow-
         | up occupation variables (C2017-C2019). The CSES standard is that
         | the occupation variables are asked from those in the labor 
         | force. However, in some cases, for spouses categorized as not in
         | labor force in C2015 (codes 6-12), the occupation variables may 
         | report respondent's last occupation. Hence, the responses 
         | concerning occupation that belong to respondents not in labor 
         | force presumably reflect their previous or last occupation.
         |
         | Data on C2019 for respondents out of labor force are available

         | There is variation in the ways in which the questions about
         | respondent's spouse were administered in different election
         | studies. In some cases only those categorized as "married or
         | living together" in C2004 were asked the spouse questions,
         | while in some surveys other responses could also lead to a 
         | respondent being asked these questions. Consequently C2019 
         | sometimes includes information of spouses from respondents who
         | reported neither being married nor living together with a 
         | partner (C2004 is not code 1.). These data remained unchanged.

         | of the primary electoral districts, coded in C2031. However,

         | it is possible to vote in a district different than the one of

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NEW ZEALAND (2008): C2027
         |
         | New Zealand regional differences are weak, primarily based on        
         | historical settlement patterns, and political differences 
         | between them. They can usually be decomposed into 
         | socio-demographic variables. 
         |
         | Regions have been defined by grouping electoral districts into
         | the following: 
         |
         | CSES Code      Election Study Code/Category

         |        06.     South Island
         |          
         | Of these, Auckland and the South Island stand out as the most
         | distinctive politically, with the South Island assumed to be 
         | more conservative in its voting habits and Auckland, the largest
         | city and commercial centre, tending to be associated with 
         | change. Wellington, the capital, is to some extent shaped by its
         | greater concentration of public sector employment.

         |
         | Note that C2028 was not asked in the Greek questionnaire of 
         | 2009, "due to very high percentages of racial and linguistic 
         | homogeneity".

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - HONG KONG (2008): C2028
         |
         | The Hong Kong questionnaire of origin does not include a 
         | question about the race of respondents. As our collaborators 
         | pointed out, "Hong Kong is a racially homogenous society, with 
         | over 95% of its population ethnic Chinese. To serve as a proxy, 
         | [one] may consult [C2026], which asked the main language usually
         | spoken at home."

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - ICELAND (2007, 2009): C2028
         | 
         | Note that the respondents were not asked their race.
         | The collaborator reported that this question was not applicable  
         | in Iceland.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - IRELAND (2007): C2028-C2029
         | 
         | Note that respondents were not asked for their race or
         | ethnicity due to a low variance for Irish citizens.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - JAPAN (2007): C2028
         |
         | This question was not asked in Japan 2007, as the collaborators 
         | pointed out that "almost all respondents had been Japanese and
         | consequently of Asian race."

         | collaborators, who pointed out that questions like these "are

         | Note that the electoral districts in Brazil are equivalent to
         | the states, with the exception of one: the Federal District. For 
         | procedural reasons, five electoral districts in the region North 
         | (Acre, Amapa, Rondonia, Roraima) and Center (Tocantins) were 
         | left out of the data sampling procedure. According to the 
         | National Household Survey PNAD2003 these 5 states represent 2%
         | of the population.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GREECE (2009): C2031
         |
         | Note that the categories of the primary electoral districts 
         | equal those of the regions of residence, coded in C2027.
         | However, research should care about the fact, that according to 
         | Greek law it is possible to vote in a district different than 
         | the one of residence. Consequently, C2027 and C2031 do not 
         | perfectly match.
         | Moreover, C2031 includes missing values for 69 respondents. 
         | Research, interested in the district results of respondents
         | might use C2027 as a proxy for the missing cases of C2031, but
         | should keep in mind that C2027 does not necessarily reflect the
         | real electoral district of respondents.
         | For the labels of C2031, see appendices of the current codebook.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - POLAND (2007): C2031
         |
         | Researchers should note that C2031 actually includes 183

         |
         | The Taiwan collaborator was unable to provide primary electoral
         | districts for the respondents. However, in Taiwan the
         | residential regions closely relate to primary electoral
         | districts. Accordingly, the region variable (C2027) has been
         | employed as a proxy for C2031. It should be noted that some
         | regions were divided into multiple electoral districts. 
         | Specifically, Taipei County (code 00001) contains three 
         | primary districts, Taipei City (code 00063) contains two primary
         | districts and Kaohsiung City (code 00064) contains two primary
         | districts.
         | Also note that there were no respondents from 02 Tayyuan City,

         | In contrast, the corresponding respondents mentioned a party to

         | In the actual CSES data, reported answers on the second 
         | sociotropic problem were coded as most important problems, while 
         | the second mention was defined as a missing value for all of

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - BRAZIL (2010): C3009_D, C3009_F, C3009_G
         |
         | Respondents' evaluation of parties D (PR), F (PSB), and G (PP)
         | were not part of the micro-questionnaire. In contrast, data 
         | about these parties are included in the district-as well as in 
         | the macro-part of the CSES data.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - DENMARK (2007): C3009 A-C3009_I
         |
         | The Danish questionnaire offered a slightly different answer 
         | for code "96. HAVEN'T HEARD OF PARTY". The original wording 
         | was "Does not have sufficient knowledge about the party to 
         | answer the question" ("Ved ikke nok om partiet"). Thus, there 
         | are several respondents that mentioned not to know a party in
         | C3009_ who were able to answer C3011_ on that same party.
         |
         | CSES Code      Election Study Code/Categories:
         |        96.     Does not have sufficient knowledge about the 
         |                party to answer the question

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GERMANY (2009): C3009_G
         |
         | Respondent's evaluation on the National Democratic Party (NPD),
         | was not part of the micro-questionnaire.
         | In contrast, the NPD is included in the district-as well as in
         | the macro-part of the CSES data.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - HONG KONG (2008): C3009_E
         |
         | In general, the order of parties A to I follow the election 
         | results of parties' vote share. In contrast, respondents were
         | not asked to evaluate the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions 
         | (PARTY E), which only consists of missing values.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - ISRAEL (2006): C3009 A-C3009_I
         |
         | In the Russian questionnaire, the wording refers more to 
         | support, rather than strongly like- strongly dislike. The 
         | question ranges between "does not support at all" to "greatly
         | support." While in Hebrew, the chosen terminology varies in 
         | terms of "attraction/repulsion".

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - PHILIPPINES (2010): C3009_
         |
         | The Philippine part of the CSES mainly focuses on the 
         | presidential election of 2010, which defines the order of 
         | parties (A through I) in C3009_ (see codebook appendices). 
         | Consequently, there is no party affiliation of the two 
         | independent presidential candidates (J. Perlas and J.Madrigal).
         | Thus, parties G and H remain unobserved and are coded as missing
         | values (code 99) in C3009_G and C3009_H.
         | See also notes on C3011_ and C3014_.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SWITZERLAND (2007): C3009_A-C3009_I
         |
         | Notice that this variable was asked to a subset of the sample
         | which responded by a follow-up mail/online questionnaire. See 
         | study description and variable note C1007 for further details.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - TURKEY (2011): C3009_D
         |
         | Note that the Peace and Democracy Party (BDP) did not run
         | for election as an officially listed party. Instead, their
         | members contested as independent candidates.
         | However, the Turkish survey asks respondents to evaluate
         | the BDP on the like-dislike scale.

         Q10a-i. And what do you think of the presidential candidates/party
         leaders? After I read the name of a presidential candidate/party  
         leader, please rate them on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 means 
         you strongly dislike that candidate and 10 means that you strongly
         like that candidate.  If I come to a presidential candidate/party 
         leader you haven't heard of or you feel you do not know enough 
         about, just say so.  The first is [LEADER A].
         Using the same scale, where would you place, [LEADER B]?
         Using the same scale, where would you place, [LEADER C]?
         Using the same scale, where would you place, [LEADER D]?
         Using the same scale, where would you place, [LEADER E]?
         Using the same scale, where would you place, [LEADER F]?

         | parliamentary elections' vote shares in descending order. 
         | For party F we do not have any information. Heloísa Helena,
         | from party P-Sol only played a minor role in the parliamentary
         | votes' results but was important in the presidential election.
         | She was thus added to letter I.
         | Note that in the election study from Brazil there were also
         | questions about two candidates from governor's elections, José

         | PDS. 
         |
         | As a representative of party E (The Greens) Joschka Fischer 
         | was mentioned in the German questionnaire. However, researchers 
         | should note that J. Fischer resigned from leadership in 1998 
         | but still remains the most important politician of the
         | German Greens.

         | the most important minister and most popular politician
         | of the CSU.
         |
         | C3010_I refers to Mr. Gregor Gysi who forms a double leadership

         |
         | The Polish study asked respondents to evaluate both of the 
         | Kaczynski brothers on the like-dislike-scale. Due to the fact
         | that both played a major role in the 2005 election, information
         | for Jaroslaw Kaczynski was kept in an additional variable 
         | C3010_I, while Lech Kaczynski was kept in C3010_A.

         | Democrats on the left-right-scale. As our Estonian collaborators
         | mentioned, "The Social Democrats are programmatically clearly 
         | leftwing, they have however frequently been a junior partner in
         | a coalition with the conservative Pro Patria and Res Publica 
         | Union and with the liberal Reform Party. This has contributed 
         | towards a public perception of being more centrist than their 
         | program and policy statements would actually indicate. The 
         | different score therefore reflects a slight contradiction 
         | between their formal position and their actions while being a
         | coalition partner."

         | Respondent's evaluation on the National Democratic Party (NPD),
         | was not part of the micro-questionnaire.
         | In contrast, the NPD is included in the district- as well as in
         | the macro-part of the CSES data.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - HONG KONG (2008): C3011
         |
         | Researchers should be aware that there are some differences
         | between the sample mean of party evaluation on the 
         | 'left-right'-scale and the expert scoring, especially for the 
         | League of Democrats, the Hong Kong Association for Democracy and
         | People's Livelihood, and the Liberal Party. Accordingly, our 
         | collaborators pointed out that the "Left-Right division has a 
         | complicated meaning in Hong Kong. There are at least 3 
         | dimensions: (1) 'left' for 'pro-Beijing' (...), and 'right' for 
         | 'pro-KMT' (KMT stands for Kuomintang, the ruling party in China 
         | before 1949 and Taiwan after 1949); (2) 'left' for advocating 
         | liberal / socialist / anti-market socio-economic policies, and 
         | 'right' for advocating conservative / capitalist / pro-market 
         | policies; and (3) 'left' for approving a radical approach to 
         | fighting for rights and changes, and 'right' for disapproving a 
         | radical approach. The three dimensions do not coincide for 
         | individual parties. Some parties are pro-Beijing, advocating 
         | liberal / socialist / anti-market socio-economic policies, but 
         | disapprove a radical approach (e.g. Democratic Alliance for 
         | Betterment of Hong Kong). Other parties are advocating liberal /
         | socialist / anti-market socio-economic policies, and approve a 
         | radical approach to fighting for rights and changes (e.g. League
         | of Social Democrats)."
         | In contrast, the expert score was based on the assessment of the
         | parties according to the second dimension, while respondents 
         | might have given their score based on one rather than other 
         | dimensions.
         |
         | In general, the order of parties A to I follows the election 
         | results of parties' vote share. Respondents were
         | not asked to evaluate the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions
         | (PARTY E), thus it consists of missing values.

         |
         | Note the somewhat unusual distribution of the Left-Right ratings
         | of the parties, leaning towards the extremes. Note also that the
         | party placements highly correlate with the evaluation of the 
         | corresponding parties on the like-dislike scale. The 
         | authenticity of the data have been verified with the 
         | collaborators . These features seem to represent relatively 
         | consistent features of the survey results in Mexico, reported 
         | across time, and by various survey projects (e.g., 
         | Latinobarometro, WVS).

         | scales in Mexico, consult Beltrán, 2009.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - PHILIPPINES (2010): C3011_
         |
         | The Philippine part of the CSES mainly focuses on the 
         | presidential election of 2010, which defines the order of 
         | parties (A through I) in C3011_ (see codebook appendices). 
         | Consequently, there is no party affiliation of the two 
         | independent presidential candidates (J. Perlas and J.Madrigal).
         | Thus, parties G and H remain unobserved and are coded as missing
         | values (code 99) in C3011_G and C3011_H.
         | See also notes on C3009_ and C3014_.
         |
         | Moreover, respondents' party evaluation on the left-right scale 
         | (C3011_) differs from the expert scoring, coded in C5017_.  
         | According to our collaborators, the left-right scale is mainly 
         | unknown in the Philippines. In addition, Philippine elections are 
         | highly personalized, diminishing the relevance of political 
         | parties in the electoral campaigns.
         
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - PORTUGAL (2009): C3011_G
         |
         | Researchers should note that in comparison with the expert
         | evaluation, respondents' mean differs by about 1.5 points.
         | Our Portuguese collaborators emphasize that this might 
         | be due to differences in the criteria of evaluation: "Experts 
         | made their evaluation taking into account not only the position 
         | of the party regarding economic issues but also regarding (...)
         | moral issues, and others like the position of CDS/PP facing 
         | criminality. This positions the party the right spectrum, (...).
         | In the case of the respondents, their evaluation probably 
         | concentrated on more salient issues - namely economy - where the
         | position of the party is closer to the center, (...)."

         | Note that the wording of the questions on C3011_ differ slightly
         | from the CSES questionnaire: "In politics, people sometimes talk 
         | of "left" (or "radical") and "right" (or "conservative"). Where 
         | would you place [PARTY] on a scale from 0 to 10 where 0 means 
         | the lef[t] and 10 means the right?"

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - THAILAND (2007): C3011_

         | for election as an officially listed party. Instead, their
         | members contested as independent candidates.
         | However, the Turkish survey asks respondents to evaluate
         | the BDP on the like-dislike scale.

         | neutral mid-point of five. In the case of Romania, our 
         | collaborators assume "some sort of post-communism effect'. 
         | People are still sensitive to self-placing on the Left of the 
         | political spectrum, as they place the sign of equal between Left
         | and communism. As the topic of communist (Russia-oriented) vs. 
         | anti-communist (West-oriented) has been a matter of political 
         | debate during the campaign, it is likely that this effect 
         | introduced a stronger bias towards Right than usually."

         |
         | The optional scale refers to Russia as a security threat for 
         | Estonia. The question of origin was: "In politics people 
         | sometimes talk of Russia being a security threat to Estonia or
         | a trustworthy partner. Where would you place "PARTY" on a scale 
         | from 0 to 10 where 0 means Russia is a security threat and 10

         | Researchers should take note of a difference between the mean-
         | scoring of respondents and the expert evaluation of the People's
         | Union on the optional scale. As our Estonian collaborators
         | mentioned, "The Peoples Union is not emphasizing their foreign 
         | policy agenda (it is a clearly rural party), but in actual 
         | questions on Russia (such as a discussion over signing a border
         | treaty with Russia) they have usually sided with the 
         | conservative parties. I assume the divergence between the 
         | positions is caused by them being largely absent from public 
         | discussions on foreign policy issues, i.e. there is not much 
         | easily accessible information on their stance and hence also the
         | more likely placement closer to the centre on the anti- or pro-
         | Russia axis by the population. Their actual voting records in 
         | parliament, on the other hand, show a more anti-Russian bias, 
         | which the experts took into account."

         | According to the length of the telephone interviews, an optional
         | scale for the party evaluation was not included in the micro 
         | questionnaire of Hong Kong 2008. However, experts' evaluations 
         | are available in C5018_A to C5018_H, referring to the "pro-

         | Political parties differ on how environmentalist they are.
         | Now I ask you to place the political parties on a scale from
         | 0 to 10, where 0 means that the party is not environmentalist
         | at all but 10 that it is very environmentalist. Where would

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - PHILIPPINES (2010): C3014_
         |
         | The optional scale, used in the Philippine data, refers to the 
         | question: "Where would you place each political party I will 
         | mention, if number 0 means that the only thing important to 
         | [NAME OF PARTY] is eradicating graft and corruption in 
         | government and number 10 means that the only thing important to
         | [NAME OF PARTY] is helping the poor?"
         | These two dimensions illustrate the two most important issues in 
         | the electoral campaigns, reflecting political positions of the 
         | main contenders. 
         |
         | CSES Code      Election Study Code/Categories:
         |        00.     Only eradicating graft and corruption in 
         |                government is important
         |        ...
         |        10.     Only helping the poor is important
         |
         | Note that the Philippine part of the CSES mainly focuses on the
         | presidential election of 2010, which defines the order of 
         | parties (A through I) in C3011_ (see codebook appendices). 
         | Consequently, there is no party affiliation of the two 
         | independent presidential candidates (J. Perlas and J.Madrigal).
         | Thus, parties G and H remain unobserved and are coded as missing
         | values (code 99) in C3011_G and C3011_H.
         | See also notes on C3009_ and C3012_.
         |
         | Moreover, respondents' party evaluation on the alternative scale 
         | (C3014_) differs from the expert scoring, coded in C5018_. 
         | According to our collaborators, Philippine elections are 
         | highly personalized, diminishing the relevance of political 
         | parties in the electoral campaigns.

         | party. Would you say that you in general think of yourself as a
         | Conservative, a Laborite, a SV supporter, etc., or don't you
         | consider yourself affiliated with any particular party?" If a
         | respondent identified a party, the case is coded "1. Yes" to
         | this item. If respondents reported "No such ties," they are
         | coded "2. No".

         | voting on some of the levels.
         | Due to compulsory voting, non-voters have to officially justify
         | non-voting behavior on election day. The original election 
         | study data from Brazil contained more specific information for
         | those who did not vote. For the sake of comparability, in the 
         | CSES study these were all recoded into value 5:

         | Differences between C3021_1 and C3021_2 may be due to several 
         | motives, i.e. registered voters living away from their district,

         | for president, or president and senate, or president, senate and

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - AUSTRALIA (2007): C3022
         |
         | Because Australia has compulsory voting (see

         | Australian questionnaire.       

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - AUSTRIA (2008): C3022_1
         |          
         | The question was not open-ended. Instead, respondents could

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - FINLAND (2007): C3022
         |
         | Rather than an open-ended question, Finland provided a 
         | closed-list from which up to four parties were chosen by
         | respondents. Instead of providing a choice rank 1-4 here, in
         | C3022_1 are respondents' answers with one or more choices;
         | in C3022_2 those with 2 or more; in C3022_3 the ones who chose 3
         | or more and in _4 those who chose 4 parties. Due to this coding

         | mentioned eight parties in this question which correspond
         | to parties A through H. The data offer responses that

         | questionnaire.
         | In contrast, non-voters, according to C3021_1, were defined
         | on the basis of actual vote choice (B11REPS) - see C3021_1.
         | Moreover, respondents who reported an informal vote choice

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - AUSTRIA (2008): C3023_LH_PL
         |          
         | The question was not open-ended. Instead, respondents  
         | could choose their answer from a party list with seven parties  
         | and the  options "other party" and "no party". Respondents who 
         | answered "no party" but had reported that they had cast a   
         | ballot, were coded to having cast an invalid ballot.
         | Note that one respondent reports a party whom to have voted

         | Brazil has a party-list proportional system with seats
         | allocated according to the simple quotient and highest average 
         | calculations. Respondents were asked for their vote
         | choice of deputy candidates. The variable was later created by 
         | using the respective candidates' party affiliations. 
         | Since giving a candidate preference is optional for the voter, 
         | the data in this variable contains a lot of missing values.
         | 7 respondents answered that they voted for a party list. Those
         | answers have missing party affiliations, too.
         | Also the high number of respondents who do not know whom they
         | voted for may be partially resulted by the question, because it
         | is usually more difficult to remember a candidate's name than a
         | party voted for.

         | For the CSES data, only the vote choice of the geographical

         | eligible to vote.
         | Researchers interested in the individual vote choices within the

         | Finally, researchers should note that in contrast to the given

         | been candidate mentions. Compared to C3028_LH_ and C3030_LH_,
         | C3023_LH_DC only includes candidates' parties that have been
         | registered for respondents' geographical constituencies.

C3026    >>> Q21E. CURRENT ELECTION: DID R CAST CANDIDATE PREFERENCE VOTE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

         If an open-list electoral system was used for the legislative
         election in question and respondent cast a ballot:

         Q21e. This variable reports whether or not the respondent cast a 
         preference vote for a candidate. 

         For instance, if votes are cast for party lists, but citizens 
         can, in addition to that, mark a preference for one or more 
         candidates on the party list, then Q21e may show answers to a 
         question like this: "Did you simply vote for a party or did you 
         also express a candidate preference?" In party list systems where 
         voters have to vote directly for a candidate and cannot cast a 
         vote just for the party list as such (e.g. Estonia, Finland, the 
         Netherlands, Poland), the question for Q21e should read like this:
         "Do you consider the vote that you cast merely a vote for the 
         party, or did you also mean it as a vote for a particular 
         candidate?"

         | To avoid adding many columns with extremely sparse data, we have
         | included up to 9 variables for C3028_LH with the intention to 
         | secure registering, if applicable, responses that refer to
         | parties A through I.
         | Moreover, whenever a respondent mentioned more than 9 parties
         | we included only those responses that refer to parties
         | A to I. With this coding rule, we are only dropping the 
         | responses from two survey respondents (each from Finland and
         | Sweden).
         |
         | The coding on C3028_ depends on C3027_. Respondents that 
         | mentioned not having considered to vote for someone else (C3027 
         | is code 5) are excluded from C3028_.

         |          
         | The question was not asked open-ended. Instead, respondents
         | could choose their answer from a party list with seven parties 
         | and the options "other party" and "no party". Respondents who
         | answered "no party" but had reported that they had considered
         | voting for others were coded as missing.

         | Brazil has a party-list proportional system with seats
         | allocated according to the simple quotient and highest average 
         | calculations. Respondents were asked for their alternative vote
         | choice of deputy or senate candidates, respectively. The 
         | variable was later created by using the respective candidates'
         | party affiliations. Since giving a candidate preference is
         | optional for the voter, the data in this variable contains a lot
         | of missing values.

         | The Croatian questionnaire of 2007 allowed respondents to 
         | mention up to five parties. However, no more than three 
         | mentions were given by any single respondent.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - CZECH REPUBLIC (2010): C3028_LH
         |
         | Although answers reflect the order in which respondents answered
         | this question, respondents were provided with a list of parties
         | which ran in the election and they answered with that list in
         | mind. The order of responses might thus reflect the order in the
         | list.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - DENMARK (2007): C3028_LH_
         |
         | The Danish questionnaire asks C3028_LH_ for each party, 
         | separately. Thus, a preference order in C3028_LH_ is not 
         | applicable. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - FINLAND (2007): C3028_LH
         |
         | Finland provided a closed-list of answers in which up to four
         | parties could be chosen by respondents. Instead of providing a 
         | choice rank 1-4 here, in C3028_1 are respondents' answers with 
         | one or more choices; in C3028_2 those with 2 or more; in C3028_3
         | the ones who chose 3 or more and in C3028_4 those who chose 4 
         | parties.

         | Researchers should note that in contrast to 
         | the suggested coding scheme, referring to parties, the original 
         | answers had been candidate mentions. Compared to C3023_LH_DC, 
         | C3028_LH_ also includes candidates' parties outside respondents'
         | geographical constituencies.

         | The Polish study of 2007 used a closed list to ask for 
         | C3028_LH_1. Respondents who mentioned a party out of this list
         | were coded as "OTHER PARTY" (for more detail see Codebook

         |
         | Note that the question on C3028_LH was asked separately for each

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SOUTH AFRICA (2009): C3028_LH
         |
         | The South African questionnaire of origin asked for each single
         | party separately. As a consequence, preference order is not 
         | applicable. Moreover, even though respondents had to respond for
         | each party, none of them mentioned more than two parties in the
         | variable set of C3028_LH.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SPAIN (2008): C3028_LH_
         | 
         | Questions on C3028_LH_ were asked separately for each of the
         | major parties, as reported in the current codebook appendices.
         | Consequently, C3028_LH_1 through C3028_LH_5 do not reflect any
         | preference order of respondents.

         |
         | This variable was applied differently in the Switzerland survey.
         | Respondents were asked whether they considered voting for each 
         | party separately. 
         | Additionally, responses make reference to lower house contest.
         | See note C3027_LH for further details.
         | However, the additional mention variables C3028_LH_5 to 
         | C3028_LH_9 refer to party mentions.
         | Also notice that this variable was asked to a subset of the

         | In the original questionnaire these questions were intended to
         | capture spontaneous answers, with the respondent mentioning a
         | set of parties, and the recorded values indicating the order of
         | response. However, some studies asked these questions
         | with a predetermined list of political parties, and asked about
         | one party at a time. By asking these questions in this way, the
         | order of the responses is lost.

         | Additionally, when asked about one party at a time, a minority
         | of respondents end up mentioning many more parties than usual.
         | To avoid adding many columns with extremely sparse data, we have
         | included up to 9 variables with the intention to secure
         | registering, if applicable, responses that refer to parties A
         | through I. Moreover, whenever a respondent mentioned more than
         | 9 parties we included only those responses that refer to parties
         | A to I. With this coding rule we are only dropping less than
         | 1% of the responses contained in the entire sample.
         |
         | The coding on C3030_ depends on C3029_. Respondents that 
         | mentioned that there are no parties they would never vote for 
         | (C3027 is code 5) are excluded from C3030_.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - AUSTRIA (2008): C3030_LH
         |          
         | The question was not open-ended. Instead, respondents  
         | could choose their answer from a party list with seven parties  
         | and the option "other party".

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - BRAZIL (2006): C3030_UH
         | 
         | Brazil has a party-list proportional system with seats
         | allocated according to the simple quotient and highest average 
         | calculations. Respondents were asked for the deputy or senate
         | candidate for whom they would never vote for. The variable was
         | later created by using the respective candidates' party
         | affiliations. Since giving a candidate preference is optional
         | for the voter, the data in this variable contains a lot of
         | missing values.

         |       90.      The party affiliation of the mentioned name 
         |                was not found. The person could be either an
         |                independent candidate or the answer might be 
         |                inappropriate.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - CROATIA (2007): C3030_LH
         |
         | The Croatian questionnaire followed the implementation for CSES
         | closely, allowing respondents up to five party mentions at most. 
         | However, no more than four parties have been mentioned by any 
         | single respondent.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - CZECH REPUBLIC (2010): C3030_LH
         |
         | Although answers reflect the order in which respondents answered
         | this question, respondents were provided with a list of parties
         | which ran in the election and they answered with that list in
         | mind. The order of responses might thus reflect the order in the
         | list.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - DENMARK (2007): C3030_LH_
         |
         | The Danish questionnaire asks C3030_LH_ for each party, 
         | separately. Thus, a preference order in C3030_LH_ is not 
         | applicable. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - FINLAND (2007): C3030_LH
         |
         | Rather than an open-ended question, Finland provided a 
         | closed-list from which respondents could choose as many answers
         | as they wished. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GERMANY (2005): C3030_LH
         |
         | The German questionnaire of 2005 asked this question separately 
         | for each of the parties which contested in the national 
         | election. 
         | The additional mention variables C3030_LH_5 to C3030_LH_9 refer
         | to party mentions.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GERMANY (2009): C3030_LH
         |
         | Variables C3030_LH_5 to C3030_LH_9 refer to additional mentions
         | of parties respondent would never vote for. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - HONG KONG (2008): C3030_LH
         |
         | Researchers should note that in contrast to 
         | the given coding schema, referring to parties, the original 
         | answers had been candidate mentions. Compared to C3023_LH_DC, 
         | C3030_LH_ also includes candidates' parties outside respondents'
         | geographical constituencies.
         | For further information see variable note on C3023_LH_DC.
         | Moreover, according to the explanations of our collaborators, 
         | the label "'independents' in Hong Kong means 'not affiliated 
         | with any political parties' and does not necessarily mean that 
         | the candidates' political inclinations are different from those 
         | of major political parties".
         
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - JAPAN (2007): C3030_UH
         |
         | Rather than an open-ended question, Japan provides a closed-

         |
         | The Dutch survey reports this question separately for each 
         | party. Up to 11 mentions were recorded. CSES dropped mentions 
         | of the category "Others", and of the party with lowest vote 
         | return (Trots op Nederland, Rita Verdonk). The variables for
         | C3030_LH do not reflect any preference order, but rather, if 
         | each party was mentioned by respondents.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NORWAY (2009): C3030_LH
         |
         | Note that the question on C3030_LH was asked separately for each
         | of the eight major Norwegian parties. Thus, a rank order of 
         | response is not applicable.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - POLAND (2007): C3030_LH_1
         |
         | Note that the Polish studies used closed lists to ask 
         | respondents about parties they would never vote for in the Lower
         | House. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SOUTH AFRICA (2009): C3030_LH
         |
         | The South African questionnaire of origin asked for each single
         | party separately. As a consequence, preference order is not 
         | applicable.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SPAIN (2008): C3030_LH_
         | 
         | Questions on C3030_LH_ were asked separately for each of the
         | major parties, as reported in the current codebook appendices.
         | Consequently, C3030_LH_1 through C3030_LH_7 do not reflect any
         | preference order of respondents. 
         
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SWEDEN (2006): C3030_LH
         |
         | Sweden asked this question separately for each party.
 
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SWITZERLAND (2007): C3030_LH
         |
         | This variable was applied differently in the Switzerland survey.
         | Respondents were asked which parties they would not vote for 
         | by asking for each party separately.
         | Additionally, responses make reference to lower house contest.
         | See note C3029_LH for further details. 
         | Also note that this variable was asked to a subset of the 
         | sample which responded by a follow-up mail/online questionnaire.
         | See study description and variable note C1007 for further 
         | details.
         | However, the additional mention variables C3030_LH_5 to 
         | C3030_LH_9 refer to party mentions.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - AUSTRALIA (2007): C3031
         |
         | Australia has compulsory voting, hence this questions was not 
         | part of the Australian questionnaire in 2007. C3031 was 
         | created using the actual vote choice for the House of 
         | Representatives (B17), defining all observations as non- voters
         | that did not report a vote choice, according to C3032_LH_DC.
         | Researchers should note that some of the included 
         | non-voters in C3031 might not have been eligible to participate 
         | in the previous election.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - AUSTRIA (2008): C3031
         |          
         | This variable was dropped in the Austrian Election Study because
         | of the late timing of the study and the considered likelihood
         | of inaccurate recall.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - BRAZIL (2006): C3031
         | 
         | Although elections on multiple levels took place on the same 
         | day, this question did not further specify the election nor the
         | ballot cast (1 or 2).
         | As the follow-up question "whom did you vote for" was asked for
         | all electoral levels (presidential, legislative candidate etc.)
         | separately, it is also not impossible to draw conclusions to
         | which part of the election respondents probably refer to with 
         | C3021_1. Also see C3021_1.
         | Also note that due to compulsory voting, non-voters have to
         | officially justify non-voting behavior on election day, if e.g.
         | they are absent from the city where they are registered. If for
         | other reasons they do not vote, and do not justify this, they
         | get fined with a symbolic amount of about US$2.
         | The original election study data from Brazil contained more
         | specific information for those who did not vote. For the sake  
         | of comparability, these were all collapsed under value 5 as
         | detailed below:

         | The questionnaire of origin asked about the participation the
         | following way:
         | "So in the last Storting' election in 2001. Who did you vote 
         | for? ", followed by a list of parties and the additional options
         | "Didn't have right to vote", "Wasn't able to vote/away", "Didn't
         | vote for other reasons", which were used to process C3031.
         | Moreover, Respondents who "refused" or mentioned "don't know" in 
         | the question of origin were coded similar in C3031 and 
         | C3032_LH_PLrefers to the Norwegian parliament election in 2001.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - PORTUGAL (2009): C3031
         |
         | The Portuguese questions about the ballot cast and the vote
         | choice in the previous election refer to the EU parliamentary
         | (EP) election of June 7th, 2009. In general CSES does not 
         | include data from any other electoral tier than the national 
         | one. Hence, the information about previous Portuguese election
         | is not included.
         | Researchers, who are interested in the data about the EP-
         | election might get back to our Portuguese collaborators, as
         | listed in the introduction part of this codebook.

         | Data for this variable are from self-reported behavior. 
         | However, when compared to official registers, some cases 
         | show differences between self-reported behavior and 
         | actual behavior. Of the people who have mentioned having 
         | voted, 94 did differently according to the official 
         | records. Conversely, of the people having mentioned that 
         | they did not vote, 12 have voted according to the official 
         | records. As well, of the people who reported not having been 
         | eligible to vote in the previous election 1 actually voted,

C3035    >>> Q23D. PREVIOUS ELECTION: DID R CAST CANDIDATE PREFERENCE VOTE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

         If an open-list electoral system was used for the legislative
         election in question and respondent cast a ballot:

         Q23d. This variable reports whether or not the respondent cast a 
         preference vote for a candidate in the PREVIOUS election.  
         
         For instance, if votes are cast for party lists, but citizens 
         can, in addition to that, mark a preference for one or more 
         candidates on the party list, then Q23d may show answers to a 
         question like this: "Did you simply vote for a party or did you 
         also express a candidate preference?" In party list systems where
         voters have to vote directly for a candidate and cannot cast a 
         vote just for the party list as such (e.g. Estonia, Finland, the 
         Netherlands, Poland), the question for Q23d should read like this:
         "Do you consider the vote that you cast merely a vote for the 
         party, or did you also mean it as a vote for a particular 
         candidate?"

         | Note that the electoral districts are sub districts within
         | regions or bigger communities. The number of seats in district
         | is thus very small and sometimes no seat is won.
         
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - ESTONIA (2011): C4001
         | 
         | Due to the cumulative coding of the electoral districts in 
         | C2031, respondents' districts in Tallinn City (districts 1, 
         | 2 & 3) are not distinguishable. Hence, seats in the three 
         | electoral districts of Tallinn City are missing.

         | Note that C4001 reflects the seats in the 56 single- or multi-
         | member district, 288 seats in total. In contrast, the remaining
         | 12 seats of the Hellenic parliament originate from a single 
         | multi-member nationwide constituency for the State Deputies, 
         | which are not listed here.

         This variable reports the number of candidates who contested
         seats in each district.  These data are reported for systems
         in which electors vote for candidates directly as well as for
         systems in which electors may cast a preference ballot (i.e.,
         where a voter can indicate a candidate from a party list, in 
         addition to casting a ballot for a party list).

         | district, and the second vote for the party list at the level of 
         | the federal states (the so called Bundeslaender). While the 
         | first vote equals the conditions of pluralism, the second vote 
         | gives the overall distribution of the Lower House. 
         | The given "turnout in district by parties A to I", reflects

         |
         | The Lower Chamber (Cámara de Representantes; House of 
         | Representatives) of the Uruguayan General Assembly consists of 
         | 99 members. Seats are assigned among parties in a single 
         | nationwide district, based on a proportional (d'Hondt) system. 
         | The system uses closed lists and Double Simultaneous Vote (DSV) 
         | in regional districts. 
         | DVS is the system by which the voter votes synchronously in a 
         | logical order: first by a party ("lema" or label or motto) and 
         | then a list of candidates ("lista" or list). 
         | There are two assignation levels: parties ("lemas") and lists 
         | (there are no "sublemas" as in the Senate votes). Voters cast a 
         | ballot with a "lema" and closed and blocked list. Votes by party
         | ("lema") are counted in a single nationwide district by d'Hondt 
         | method, and this count determines the number of seats a party 
         | obtains. Votes by lists are counted by districts (following 
         | d'Hondt method), and this count determines the seat distribution
         | within parties. Each party typically has several lists in each 
         | district.
         | In order to contest the election, each electoral agent presents 
         | its own ballot (in the 2009 election there were 21 to 39 ballots
         | by district). One electoral agent can be a party, a party 
         | fraction or a fraction of party fraction. Voters select one 
         | ballot (among these 21 to 39 ballots in each district, in the 
         | 2009 national election), and puts it in the ballot box. 
         | Ballot contains a presidential ticket, a closed list for Senate,
         | and a closed list for the Lower Chamber. Each ballot must 
         | necessarily contain lists of a single party. Electors cast 
         | votes necessarily (for President and 2 chambers) for the same 
         | party. Hence, the elections results are basically identical for 
         | all three institutions - both houses of the Parliament, and for
         | the President (first round). DVS is a mechanism which allows an
         | intra-partisan contest at the time of the national election.

         |
         | The Upper chamber (Cámara de Senadores; Senate) of the Uruguayan
         | General Assembly consists of 31 members. Thirty members are 
         | elected by proportional representation (d'Hondt) in a single 
         | nationwide district, using closed list system and Triple 
         | Simultaneous Vote (TVS) mechanism. There is also one ex officio 
         | member - the Vice-President of the Republic (directly elected on
         | ticket with President of the Republic).
         | In TVS the voter votes synchronously in a complex logical order:
         | first by a party ("lema"), second by a fraction (called 
         | "sublema", means under-label or under-motto) and then by a 
         | closed and blocked list.
         | In TVS the votes are counted (and seats are distributed):
         | a. First. The votes are counted exclusively at the level of 
         | parties ("lemas"). All seat are distributed exclusively at the
         | level of parties ("lemas"), independently of the votes cast by
         | fractions ("sublemas") and lists
         | b. Second. Within each party ("lema"), the votes are counted 
         | exclusively at level of fractions ("sublemas"). All seats of the
         | party are distributed exclusively at the level of fractions 
         | ("sublemas"), independently of the votes cast by lists and 
         | independently of the votes cast by other parties.
         | c. Third. Within each fraction ("sublema") the votes are counted
         | only at the level of  lists. All seats of the fraction 
         | ("sublema") are distributed exclusively at the level of lists, 
         | independently of the votes cast by other fractions ("sublemas") 
         | of the same party and independently of the votes cast by other 
         | parties.
         | Multiple Simultaneous Vote (MVS) is the generic name of the 
         | system, comprising the Double Simultaneous Vote (used in 
         | elections for the Uruguayan lower House) and TVS. The MVS is the
         | inverse of apparentement, in which votes are cast by lists, 
         | which are added by the effect of apparentement.
         | In order to contest the election, each electoral agent presents 
         | its own ballot (in the 2009 election there were 21 to 39 ballots
         | by district). 
         | One electoral agent can be a party, a party fraction or a 
         | fraction of party fraction. Voters select one ballot (among 
         | these 21 to 39 ballots in each district, in the 2009 national
         | election), and puts it in the ballot box. Ballot contains a 
         | presidential ticket, a closed list for Senate, and a closed list
         | for the Lower Chamber. Each ballot must necessarily contain 
         | lists of a single party. Electors cast votes necessarily (for
         | President and 2 chambers) for the same party. Hence, the 
         | elections results are basically identical for all three 
         | institutions - both houses of the Parliament, and for the 
         | President (first round).
         | Votes are counted by the above described Double Simultaneous 
         | Vote (DSV; Lower House), and Multiple Simultaneous Vote (MVS; 
         | Upper House). DVS or MVS is a mechanism which allows an intra-
         | partisan contest at the time of the national election.

         | after citizens register to vote in offices of the Electoral 
         | Commission (IFE), they have to go back to pick up a valid ID
         | that IFE issues called "Padrón" (Electoral Roll). Some 
         | citizens who requested their voting ID-Card do not claim it 
         | afterwards, and these ID's are destroyed since they can not 
         | show a valid ID on election day, and thus, they cannot vote. 
         | The list of those who registered and got their valid ID is 
         | called the "lista nominal" which is the actual list of voters.

         | Note from the Collaborator: Notice that the number of registered
         | voters is larger than the voting age population (8%). In an 
         | extraordinary effort done in the 1990's, in a house by house 
         | visit the Electoral Commission made a census of all eligible  
         | voters. Independent estimates found that this original census 
         | covered close to 98% of the voting age population of the time
         | (persons 18 years older and more). These differences indicate 
         | that the actual list of eligible voters ("lista nominal") has
         | not been fully updated, most likely because of deceased voters
         | who are not erased from the list. Another likely source of error
         | might be due to errors in the estimate of age in limited census 
         | of 2005.

         |
         | according to the collaborator it is impossible to provide a 
         | proper Left-Right placement of the UDMR. The Democratic Alliance
         | of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR) is a political organization 
         | representing the Hungarian minority in Romania. Although not 
         | officially registered as a political party, it is the equivalent 
         | of an ethnic party that competes in every election and passes 
         | the threshold. Although affiliated to the European People's Party
         | (EPP), it puts together several smaller platforms of different 
         | ideological orientations (christian-democratic, social democratic,
         | liberal, etc.). These platforms stick together in order to pass 
         | the electoral threshold, as they all represent primarily the 
         | interests of the Hungarian minority.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - BRAZIL (2006): C5019
         |
         | A more detailed description of the most salient factors
         | in the election is included here:
         |
         |   055. Re-election of president Lula. (At the time of
         |        election, President Lula had high levels of 
         |        government approval).
         |   056. Public debate about privatization and the role of state. 
         |        President Lula as candidate has emphasized the role of 
         |        state in economy and social policies. The main adversary
         |        (PSDB Alckmin) emphasized the positive aspects of 
         |        privatization.
         |   057. The role of media. Some political specialists affirm
         |        that the second round of election only happened because 
         |        President Lula didn't appear in a campaign debate at 
         |        television 3 days before the day of election. All surveys 
         |        reported that President Lula would win for Presidency in
         |        the first round, due to his wide approval and popularity.
         |   058. Corruption crisis affecting the president Party (PT). In 
         |        2005 there was a corruption scandal involving some 
         |        politicians in the National Congress and some political 
         |        parties, related to electoral financing campaign in 2002 
         |        and benefits to politicians at Parliament.
         |   059. Social Programs. Bolsa Familia, a redistribution of 
         |        income program was the landmark of the government, it 
         |        changed the geographic distribution of votes for Lula to
         |        the poor areas of the country; the vote for Lula was 
         |        historically concentrated in the richer areas of the 
         |        country, identified to left vote.     

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - BRAZIL(2010): C5019
         | 
         | A more detailed description of the five most salient factors
         | in the election is included here:
         | 
         |   148. Continuity of President Lula's government. (At the time 
         |        of election, President Lula had high levels of government
         |        approval, the highest in the 2 terms of mandate - 83% of 
         |        approval)
         |   149. Maintenance of federal social programs (specially the 
         |        income transfer programs) and economic policy. Economic 
         |        policy benefited middle classes and the consumption 
         |        opportunities; in 2010 socioeconomic data revealed that 
         |        the "C Class" was about 52% of the population.
         |   150. Abortion and Religion. Near to the election day the 
         |        campaign turned highly conservative, a strategy of the 
         |        opposition to differentiate itself from the government 
         |        electoral agenda. The government candidate Dilma Roussef 
         |        (Worker's Party) used to be a leftist militant in 
         |        terrorist organizations during the military regime, and 
         |        during the campaign publicly defined abortion as a public
         |        health problem, not a Catholic or religious issue. The 
         |        main adversary (PSDB-Jose Serra) emphasized the role of 
         |        religion in public issues. Analysts agree to that was the
         |        main cause the Government's candidate did not win the 
         |        election in the first round, she won in the second round.
         |   151. Corruption crisis affecting the government. In 2010 there
         |        was scandals involving some ministries.

         | in the election is included here:
         |
         |   026. Ideological and party loyalty of the voters of the two

         | A more detailed description of the most salient factors
         | in the election is included here:
         |
         |   107. Economic issues concerning taxation, social welfare and
         |        health care.
         |   108. The election campaign featured negative personal attacks
         |        on political opponents: A week before Election Day, with 
         |        the assistance of MPs of the opposition ODS and governing
         |        KDU-CSL, a secret report by Police Colonel Kubice was 
         |        published, pointing to possible links between the then
         |        Prime Minister and CSSD Party leader, Paroubek, and  
         |        organized crime. For ODS and other parties, the 
         |        publishing of the secret report was a way to criticize 
         |        the corrupting and 'mafia-like' style of CSSD's politics.
         |   109. A day before the elections were to take place, in the 
         |        editorials of three out of four major dailies, the 
         |        editors in-chief recommended that voters did not vote for
         |        the Communists or Social Democrats, but that they cast 
         |        their vote in favor of liberal and conservative parties.
         |   110. Unexpected increase in the support of Green party between
         |        January to March 2006 from almost nothing to 7 percent.

         | in the election is included here:
         |
         |   192. Economic crisis and country's budgetary deficit was used
         |        by the centre-right parties as a tool to strengthen their
         |        position and proclaim the need of cutting spending against
         |        often populist promises of the left in areas of social 
         |        spending, tax and healthcare.
         |   193. Rise of distrust to traditional, namely two largest 
         |        parties (ODS and CSSD), emergence of new political subjects

         |   156. Higher wages for public employees

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - ESTONIA (2011): C5019
         |
         | A more detailed description of the most salient factors
         | in the elections is included here:
         |
         |   143. As Estonia had been hit very hard by the global economic
         |        and financial crisis (the economy contracted by nearly 
         |        15% in 2009; in 2010, GDP expanded by 3.1%), issues 
         |        related to economic recovery and job creation dominated
         |        political debates. The key question dividing voters was
         |        how to assess the government's response to the crisis.
         |   144. Edgar Savisaar, head of the biggest opposition party 
         |        (the Centre Party), was mired in a major scandal after 
         |        having allegedly requested and received funding for his
         |        party from Russian sources connected to the Kremlin. The
         |        allegations were officially confirmed by the Estonian 
         |        Security Police. All other major parties ruled out 
         |        cooperation with the Centre Party as long as Edgar 
         |        Savisaar remains its leader. The scandal contributed to
         |        the polarization of the electorate along ethnic lines 
         |        and intensified security concerns. The scandal broke 
         |        three months before the election and was in the 
         |        headlines throughout the campaign period.
         |   145. High levels of unemployment, coupled with concerns about
         |        rising prices made questions related to  welfare
         |        prominent in the press and in campaign manifestos. Many
         |        voters attributed price hikes to the changeover to the
         |        euro (on January 1, 2011) and critics accused the Ansip
         |        government of being overeager in pleasing Brussels (e.g.
         |        implementing ruthless budget cuts in order to comply
         |        with the convergence criteria) while neglecting the
         |        welfare of economically less-secure segments of the
         |        population.
         |   146. An unusually large number of independent candidates,
         |        some of them very prominent, ran on an anti-party 
         |        message contributing to a critical debate about the 
         |        complacency of party elites. Independent candidates were
         |        encouraged by the success of Indrek Tarand in the 2009
         |        European Parliament elections (Tarand received over a
         |        quarter of the nation-wide vote). 
         |   147. The internal turmoil in the two smallest opposition 
         |        parties (the People's Union and the Greens) led to wide-
         |        spread perditions of their demise, which in turn drove 
         |        small party supporters to vote for bigger parties (in 
         |        order to not waste their votes).

         |
         |   063. Cleavage between labour movement and non-socialist

         |        central labour federation.
         |   064. Disagreements on the possibilities for increasing
         |        welfare services and benefits, and on the possibilities

         |   065. Unemployment
         |   066. Benefits of the elderly people

         |        the prime minister.

         |   170. Increased income differences, even though still modest 
         |        in a global comparison, the Finnish electorate is 
         |        sensitive to increased economic inequalities.
         |   171. The campaigning for the position of the Prime Minister.

         |   022. Change in Party Strategy from the UDF (embodied in the 
         |        Change of name UDF MoDem): left the traditional 
         |        right-wing Alliance but no agreement came to force with 
         |        the left wing parties
         |   023. Debate about "Social VAT" (new government appointed by 
         |        the new President reasserted than an increase of VAT to
         |        decrease salary charges was possible); more salient
         |        between first and second round.
         |   024. Environment (new government was created with a 
         |        particularly large ministerial department for environment; 
         |        sustainable growth was put to the fore)
         |   025. European integration (after the no to the European 
         |        constitutional treaty in May 2005, debates about how
         |        should the new treaty be designed and consequently

         |   111. Tensions between Hong Kong and Beijing: When the tensions

         |        pro-government forces in the Legislative Council is 
         |        perceived, more voters tend to vote for candidates from 
         |        anti-government parties and candidates who are more vocal
         |        or radical.
         |   115. Candidates' quality and constituency services.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - MEXICO (2009): C5019
         |
         | A more detailed description of the most salient factors
         | in the election is included here:
         |
         |   123. The government had to pay the consequences of the 
         |        financial crisis of 2007-2009. Even though, the public 
         |        finances did not suffer severe consequences, and the 
         |        exchange rate peso-dollar did not suffer sudden and 
         |        drastic changes, GNP dropped dramatically and 
         |        unemployment spread. Therefore, the perception that the 
         |        Government did not respond in the best way to solve these
         |        problems extended, causing a great discontent and 
         |        frustration in the population. 
         |   124. The problem of crime, specially the "Drug War" - an armed
         |        conflict between rival drug cartels and government forces
         |        -, produced a lack of credibility in the Government (PAN)
         |        because the persistence of violence and murders related 
         |        to this issue.
         |   125. The former left candidate of the PRD, Andrés Manuel López
         |        Obrador, did not recognize his defeat in 2006, and has 
         |        been campaigning across the country under two small 
         |        parties (Convergencia and PT). This has created strong 
         |        problems for the leftist parties in two senses. On the one
         |        hand strong rejection of López Obrador among many 
         |        segments of the population and, strong divisions among 
         |        the parties. This deteriorated their credibility.
         |   126. General dissatisfaction with the political actors.

         | After the fall of Topolanek II cabinet in March 2009, a new 
         | nonpartisan government was established on the basis of agreement 
         | of parties, that early election is going to be held in autumn 2009
         | as a way out of political crisis. President then called the election
         | date on October 9th - October 10th 2009. However, in the end of August,
         | a deputy elected for Czech Social Democratic Party Miroslav Melcak
         | (who later became independent and voted regularly with Topolanek's 
         | government) put a complaint to the Constitutional Court against the
         | decision of President of Republic as well as against the bill on 
         | shortening the current legislative term and dissolving the House of
         | Deputies. Surprisingly, the Constitutional court decided in favour 
         | of Mr. Melcak's complaint, which provoked an extensive debate among 
         | politicians, constitutional lawyers etc. The thing was that this kind 
         | of procedure to get to early elections was already once used, without
         | being criticized. Nevertheless, the decision meant that the early
         | election cannot be held, because the bill about dissolving the lower

         | parties immediately started, but finally CSSD blocked any other

         | On 3th September 2009 Costas Karamanlis (Prime Minister of 
         | Greece since 2004) two years into his second term of office, 
         | announced an early election, due to the very difficult economic 
         | circumstances that the country was experiencing.  
         | His declared justification was that he needed to secure a 
         | mandate that would enable him to pass austerity measures. The 
         | government of New Democracy was deeply unpopular, facing 
         | numerous scandals and having been denounced for the incompetent
         | handling of the forest fires in Greece. Therefore, his decision 
         | for early elections was also related to the fact that his 
         | administration had serious legitimacy problems. In the 
         | background of this early election, we should add the prospective 
         | election of the President of the Republic, scheduled for few 
         | months later. According to the Greek Constitution, the President 
         | is elected from the parliament for a five year term. The five 
         | year term of Karolos Papoulias presidency was ending in March
         | 2010 and the opposition party of PASOK and its leader, George 
         | Papandreou declared that the party would not renew its support 
         | for Papoulias presidency. Therefore, an alternative explanation 
         | for going to the country is that the PM tried to avoid an 
         | unnecessarily prolonged pre-election period."

         | Note that in the French electoral system there are no electoral 
         | lists, so this question refers to multiple parties endorsing 
         | 'joint' candidates. In practice, candidates may declare to 
         | voters as many endorsements as they wish; yet, for party funding
         | (which is almost the only regulation on parties in France), 
         | candidates can declare only one endorsement even if they receive
         | money from more than one party.

         | For lower house elections, Australia employs the Alternative 
         | Vote system (see note C5065). In this system, voters are 
         | required to list their  preferences for as many candidates 
         | as there are on the ballot. Thus, the total number of votes 
         | varies across electoral districts.
         
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - AUSTRALIA (2007): C5038_3
         | 
         | For upper house elections, Australia employs a single-
         | transferable-vote form of proportional representation. In this
         | system each voter indicates the order of preference among all 
         | the candidates in competing in her district, or alternatively, 
         | she can indicate support for a party ticket (which determines 
         | the order of preference of candidates within the party).

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - AUSTRIA (2008): C5038_1
         |
         | The Austrian electoral system is a proportional representation
         | system with three segments or tiers. These correspond to the 
         | regional districts tier, the Land level tier (or state level) 
         | and the federal (or national) level tier. Counting and 
         | allocation of seats passes through each of these levels. 
         | However, voters cast a single vote. In this vote, they can 
         | express preferences for specific candidates, particularly, a 
         | Lander level candidate and/or for a regional level candidate.
         | However, since voters cast a single vote only, this system is
         | different from systems with multiple tiers where voters vote 
         | separately in different tiers. Hence, the system is coded as 
         | consisting of a single tier in variables C5038-C5047.

         | candidate but can split their votes between candidates nominated
         | by different parties, for a total of 400 seats. Parallel to this
         | tier, 80 seats are distributed according to PR list, in 8 
         | regional  constituencies of roughly equivalent proportions, 
         | without a threshold. Each party submits a list with 10

         Q16b. Do they vote for candidates (not party lists) or party 
         lists?
         Definition: Party bloc voting is used in multi-member districts 
         where voters cast a single party-centered vote for their party of 
         choice; the party with the most votes wins all of the district 
         seats.

         candidates who have achieved the predetermined quota are elected.

         are transferred from candidates who have more than the necessary 
         number to achieve the quota and from the candidate with the least 
         number of votes. An example of this is the election in Ireland

         | In some plurality systems, a threshold is established for a
         | declaration of "official party status" rather than for the
         | acquisition of seats in the legislature. Usually, these
         | thresholds are a certain number of seats, rather than a
         | percentage of the popular vote. For countries in which this 
         | is the case, this variable was coded "97. NOT APPLICABLE".

         | The Austrian electoral system is a proportional representation
         | system with three segments or tiers. These correspond to the 
         | federal level tier, the Land level tier (or state level) and the
         | regional districts tier. Counting and allocation of seats passes 
         | through each of these levels, and as a consequence is a three
         | step process. An electoral threshold exists within them. In 
         | first place, in each Lander a Hare quota is calculated and used
         | to distribute seats across the regional district level. Followed
         | by this seats are allocated at the Land level tier but only 
         | those parties that obtained one seat at the regional district 
         | level or 4% of the nationwide valid vote are qualified to 
         | receive seats. Finally, at the national level seats are 
         | distributed following the D'Hondt system and seats that have 
         | been already allocated are discounted.

         | thresholds  -  of which only one has to apply:
         | 1. Winning a seat directly in any of the ten multi-member
         | constituencies; 
         | 2. Obtaining in two of the three electoral provinces a number of

         | number of seats in the multi-member constituencies in the 
         | electoral provinces in question, excluding the provinces' 
         | compensatory seats); or 
         | 3. Two percent of the valid, national vote. This rule is much

         | The CSES survey was conducted for the 2009 Presidential Election,
         | the following figures are for the last parliamentary elections
         | in November 2008 (house and senate).
         |
         | The new electoral legislation (Law no. 35/2008) established a 
         | two-tier seat allocation for both Chambers of the Parliament.
         | However, the voter casts only one vote for each of the Chambers.
         | The division of seats between tiers is variable and depends on 
         | the actual result of voting.In extreme theoretical circumstances  
         | it is possible for one tier not to receive seats at all.   
         | Overhang seats are allowed.
         |
         | On the first tier, seats are allocated to candidates receiving 
         | a majority of 50%+1 of the votes cast within the representation
         | district. This district-level candidate threshold is cumulated 
         | to a national-level party one: either (a) 5% for individual 
         | parties, 8% for two-party electoral alliances, 9% for three-party 
         | electoral alliances, 10% for 4+ parties alliances; or (b) gaining
         | simultaneously 6 districts for the Chamber of Deputies and 3 for 
         | the Senate.
         |
         | On the second tier, the remaining seats are allocated according 
         | to a complicated algorithm (for details, see Marian and King 2010)
         | to other candidates based on candidate results at district level 
         | and party results at constituency level. At this level the same
         | threshold (alternatives (a) or (b) above) remains in place.

         | votes may, however, take part in the distribution of permanent
         | constituency seats in the constituency where it has gained at
         | least 12 percent of the votes cast in that constituency. [...]
         | The requirement (threshold) for election on the basis of total

C5054    >>> REGIME: TYPE OF EXECUTIVE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

         Classification of political regimes in which democracies are 
         distinguished by the type of executive (0 Dictatorship, 
         1 Parliamentary Democracy, 2 Mixed Democracy, 3 Presidential 
         Democracy). 
         
         The following decision rule is applied (see Cheibub, 2007):
         A. The system is parliamentary either (i) if there is no 
         independently (indirectly or directly) elected president or (ii) 
         if there is an independently (indirectly or directly) elected 
         president but the government is not responsible to the president.
         B. The system is mixed either if there is an independently 
         (indirectly or directly) elected president and government is 
         responsible to the president.
         C. The system is presidential if government is not responsible to
         the elected legislature.

         NOTE: Responsibility refers to whether the survival of the 
         executive depends directly on legislature (i.e. vote of 
         confidence).

         | Classifying the finish executive power is subject to some 
         | controversy. Here it is coded as a mixed or semi-presidential 
         | system. Some key features of the Finnish system that distinguish
         | it from a traditional parliamentary system are that by 
         | constitution a) the president is popularly elected by direct 
         | vote for a fixed term of six years, and for no more than two 
         | consecutive terms of office; b) the president can, on 
         | recommendation of the prime minister, dissolve the legislature; 
         | c) the president can veto legislature, though parliament can 
         | override the presidential veto with a simple majority; and 
         | d) the president may issue decrees that have force of law. More
         | details can be  found in Fish & Kroenig, 2009. That said, some

         | Note that Hong Kong is not a sovereign state, but a Special 
         | Administrative Region (SAR) in China. The Central Government 
         | authorizes the HKSAR to exercise a high degree of autonomy and 
         | enjoy executive, legislative and independent judicial power. 
         | Therefore, the HKSAR Government is kind of local government.
         | The Chief Executive (CE) is the President of the Executive 
         | Council of Hong Kong and head of the Government of the Hong 
         | Kong Special Administrative Region. The Chief Executive is 
         | elected by an 800-member Election Committee. The elected CE 
         | must then be appointed by the Central People's Government.
         | Regarding the relationship between the CE and Legislative 
         | Council, the type of executive may be regarded as some form of a
         | presidential system, because the CE and the Legco members are 
         | returned by different elections.

         database about Democratic Electoral Systems Around the World, 
         1946-2000 (http://homepages.nyu.edu/~mrg217/elections.html).
         
         PLURALITY - the candidate that obtains the most votes wins.
         ABSOLUTE MAJORITY RULE - A candidate must win over 50% of the vote
         to win. If no  candidate wins this many votes, then there is a 
         runoff between the top two candidates.
         QUALIFIED MAJORITY RULE - Each qualified majority system specifies
         a particular percentage of the vote that a candidate must win in 
         order to be elected in the first round. If two or more candidates 
         overcome these thresholds, then the one with the highest number of
         votes wins. The qualified majority systems vary in terms of the 
         electoral procedure that applies when these thresholds are not 
         met.
         ELECTORAL COLLEGE - The candidate that wins a plurality of the 
         electoral college votes wins.
         SINGLE TRANSFERABLE VOTE - Requires voters to rank single 
         candidates in order of the most to least preferred. Votes are 
         transferred until candidates obtain the Droop quota. The 
         candidates that obtains this quota first is elected.

         This is a variable indicating whether the country uses (i) a 
         majoritarian formula in all of its electoral segments (tiers), 
         (ii) a proportional formula in all of its electoral segments 
         (tiers), or (iii) a mixed formula.

         The definition of this variable is taken from Matt Golder's 
         database about Democratic Electoral Systems Around the World, 
         1946-2000 (http://homepages.nyu.edu/~mrg217/elections.html).
         
         MAJORITARIAN systems require successful candidates to win either
         a plurality or majority of the vote. As a result, they are 
         considered majoritarian.
         PROPORTIONAL systems can be divided into two types: those that use
         party lists and those like the single transferable vote that do 
         not. Those systems employing lists can themselves be divided into 
         two further categories: quota systems (with allocation of 
         remainders) and highest average systems.
         MIXED systems use a mixture of majoritarian and proportional 
         electoral rules. A country can be classified as having a mixed
         system whether it uses one or more electoral segments (tiers); in 
         practice, most mixed systems have more than one segment (tier). 
         Mixed electoral systems can be divided into those in which the 
         two electoral formulas are dependent and those in which they are 
         independent.

         | The electoral system in Spain employs proportional repre-
         | sentation in  50 multi-member constituencies corresponding to
         | the country's provinces; However, there are 2 single-member 
         | constituencies (North African enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla) 
         | that use a majoritarian formula.

         | The electoral law in the 2008 legislative election is mixed-
         | member majoritarian (MMM) system, and the total number of seats 
         | is 113. Among them, 73 seats are elected based on the single-
         | member districts (SMD), 34 seats based on the proportional  
         | representation (PR) in a nationwide district, and 6 seats for

         | The Lower Chamber (Cámara de Representantes; House of
         | Representatives) of the Uruguayan General Assembly consists 
         | of 99 members. Seats are assigned among parties in a single
         | nationwide district, based on a proportional (d'Hondt) system. 
         | The system uses closed lists and Double Simultaneous Vote (DSV)
         | in regional districts.

         |
         | The Austrian electoral system is a (non-mixed) proportional 
         | representation system with three segments or tiers. These 
         | correspond to the federal level tier, the Land level tier (or 
         | state level) and the regional districts tier. Counting and 
         | allocation of seats passes through each of these levels, and as
         | a consequence is a three step process. In first place in each 
         | Lander a Hare quota is calculated and used to distribute seats 
         | across the regional districts. That is, parties are allocated 
         | seats from each regional district depending on how often they 
         | exceeded the Land level specified quota. Followed by this seats 
         | are allocated at the Land level tier also following the Land 
         | level quota. Finally, at the national level seats are 
         | distributed following the D'Hondt system. Seats that have been 
         | already allocated in the first and second tier are deducted from
         | from the number of seats each parties obtains at the national 
         | level. Only those parties that obtain more than 4% of the 
         | national valid votes or one seat from the regional 
         | constituencies qualify to receive seats from the Lander and 
         | National seat distribution. Given this last element the 
         | electoral system is coded as linked.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - JAPAN (2007): C5060
         |
         | In Japan's mixed electoral system, seats of both tiers are 
         | allocated separately; each party is allocated its proportionate
         | share of the PR seats plus the SMD seats won by its candidates.
         | However, it is important to notice that candidates may run in 
         | both the SMD districts as well as in the party list of the PR 
         | contest. These so-called "duplicate" candidates are restricted 
         | to run only in SMD constituency located within their PR bloc.
         | While this feature might create some implicit interdependence 
         | between the segments, Japan's system is coded as un-linked since 
         | the allocation of seats of each segment in done independently,
         | without considering the marginal results of the other segment.

         | two linked tiers that use proportional representation.
         | Parties present two lists to fill the National Assembly's seats: 
         | 200 nominations on a national list' and a 200 candidates   
         | representing the nine provinces in the Assembly. Despite the
         | two lists, voters have a single vote. The tiers are linked since
         | successful candidates on a party's national list depend on its 
         | proportion of the national vote; successful candidates on its 
         | provincial lists depend on the proportion of the national vote in 
         | each province.

C5061    >>> DEPENDENT FORMULAE IN MIXED SYSTEMS

         This indicates whether the two electoral formulas used in a mixed 
         system are dependent or independent. A dependent mixed system is 
         one in which the application of one formula is dependent on the 
         outcome produced by the other formula. An independent mixed system
         is one in which the two electoral formulas are implemented 
         independently of each other.

         | Mexico's mixed electoral system is classified as dependent

         Sub-types of mixed electoral systems.
         
         COEXISTENCE: This is a system in which some districts use a 
         majoritarian formula, while others employ a proportional formula 
         in a single electoral segment (tier). Coexistence systems are 
         independent mixed systems.
         
         SUPERPOSITION: This is a system in which a majoritarian and 
         proportional formula are applied in independent electoral 
         districts. 
         
         FUSION: This is a system in which majoritarian and proportional 
         formulas are used in an independent manner within a single 
         district.
         
         CORRECTION: This is a system in which seats distributed by 
         proportional representation in one set of districts are used to 
         correct the distortions created by the majoritarian formula in 
         another. Correction systems are a dependent form of mixed system.
         
         CONDITIONAL: This is a system in which the actual use or not of 
         one electoral formula depends on the outcome produced by the 
         other. Conditional systems are a dependent form of mixed system.

         |
         | The Austrian electoral system consists of three overlapping 
         | tiers. The first tier is made of 43 regional electoral 
         | districts, the second tier of 9 Land or state level electoral 
         | districts and the third tier of one nation-wide electoral 
         | district. The number of seats allotted to each Land ahead of an
         | election depends on its census number of resident citizens plus
         | registered Austrian expatriates. The Hare electoral quota used 
         | for seat allocation both in the first and second tier is 
         | calculated at the level of the second tier. In each Land the
         | electoral quota is calculated from the number of allotted seats
         | divided by the number of valid votes cast. The electoral quota
         | thus varies by Land and the same quota is applied to the first
         | tier seat allocation in the Land's regional electoral districts.
         | Seats allocated (and votes used up) in the first tier are
         | subtracted from the number of seats (and votes) available for
         | subsequent second tier allocation. The number of seats available
         | for third tier allocation is 183 minus the number of seats
         | distributed during first and second tier allocation. The same
         | rule determines the number of remaining votes available for 
         | third tier allocation. Participation in second and third tier
         | seat allocation is restricted to parties that have gained at
         | least one first tier seat or a minimum of 4% of valid votes
         | nation-wide. Seat allocation in the third tier is through the
         | D'Hondt divisor rule.

         | There a total of 12 electoral districts. 10 districts each 
         | electing 14 representatives from party lists or independent 
         | list. The two distinctive features of the Croatian electoral law 
         | concern voting in special electoral districts: 11th district for 
         | the so-called Diaspora voters (Croatian citizens who are not 
         | resident in Croatia) and 12th district for representatives of 
         | national minorities:
         |
         | In the 11th district there were 404 950 registered voters (2007) 
         | who permanently live outside Croatia. Voters cast votes for 
         | party lists registered in this electoral district. There is a 
         | specific rule for determining the number of seats allocated in 
         | this electoral district: the number of valid votes is divided by 
         | the average number of necessary to win a seat in the electoral 
         | districts 1-10.
         |
         | In the 12th district voters who are registered as members of 
         | national minorities can cast votes for individual candidates. 
         | For this purpose there are separate sub-districts for respective
         | national minorities or groups of minorities. The Serbian 
         | minority elects three representatives and voters can cast up to 
         | three votes for individual candidates.  One representative is
         | elected by members of the following national minorities who cast 
         | one vote for the individual candidates: Italian -  Hungarian - 
         | Czech and Slovak - Austrian, Bulgarian, German, Polish, Roma,
         | Romanian, Ruthenian, Russian, Turkish, Ukrainian, Valachian and
         | Jewish - Albanian, Bosniak, Montenegrin, Macedonian and 
         | Slovenian. Voters registered as members of national minorities 
         | can forgo their right to vote in the 12th electoral district and
         | register to vote in the respective general electoral district 
         | with other Croatian citizens.

         | (total number of seats +1) +1]. If a candidate is declared
         | elected on the first count, the second preferences of the
         | candidate's surplus votes (i.e., votes over and above the
         | threshold) are then distributed among the other candidates. If
         | this redistribution does not push any of the remaining
         | candidates over the threshold, the candidate with the lowest
         | number of votes is eliminated, then the second preferences of
         | the eliminated candidate's votes are redistributed. This process
         | of redistribution of surpluses and elimination of candidates

         |
         | Owing to the quota formula: [total valid votes/(total number
         | of seats "+1") +1], the STV system in Ireland works similarly
         | as the party-list proportional representation which uses
         | the largest-reminder method with droop quota. Consequently,
         | C5065 of IRL_2007 is coded as 33.
         |
         | Please be careful that because Ireland uses STV instead of PR,
         | there are non-trivial differences between the electoral system
         | of Ireland and the other countries with the PR, for example,
         | "residual" votes go to the next preferred candidates in the STV
         | but in the PR to the next listed/ranked candidates, even though
         | both systems employ "droop" quota for the seats allocation.

         empowered to deal directly with the citizens in the exercise of 
         the legislative, administrative and taxing powers, and each 
         directly elected by the citizens." (page 12, Watts, 2008).

         | vote representing 76 provinces, 74 appointed by judges and 
         | independent government bodies; all serve six-year terms) and the

         | The United States Senate is the upper house of the bicameral
         | legislature of the United States. Together with the United 
         | States House of Representatives makes up the United States
         | Congress. Approximately one third of the Senate is renewed 
         | every two years. Senators serve terms of six years each; the 
         | terms are staggered so that approximately one-third of the 
         | seats are up for election every two years.

         Corrected Effective Number of Electoral Parties corrects for the

         suggested by Taagepera (1997). The method requires calculating the
         ENEP (C5093) two times. One is treating the "other" category as a 
         single party and the second is calculating the ENEP as if every 
         vote in the "other" category belonged to a different party. The 
         CENEP is the mean of both measures.
